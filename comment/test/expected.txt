Congratulations on your second birthday YC, and thanks to Paul Graham for
writing this forum. I had a really good look at the good a few days ago and I
was quite impressed with how elegant the whole thing is put together.

Lisp would not be my language of choice for a website like this, and yet, after
seeing how concise it was I'm tempted to play around with lisp in a web
environment.
