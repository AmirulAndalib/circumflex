As many have pointed out, a dozen or so submissions on this topic were flagged
by users. That's actually the immune system working as intended, but another
component of the system is that moderators rescue the very most historic stories
so HN can have a single big thread about them. We did that 4 years ago, also
for Brexit, etc.

Since this was the first submission on the topic, it seems fairest to be the one
to restore. (It's still on our todo list to have some form of karma sharing for
situations like this, to make it be less of a race and/or lottery.)

I changed the URL from [34mwww.cnn.com/[0m since that is not the most useful link and
the AP seems as close as one can get to a neutral source.

¬º There's a famous optical illusion ¬Ω with a spinning silhouette of a dancer.
When you ¬æ, look at it, you'll swear it's spinning in one direction ‚Äî say,
counter-clockwise. In fact, you'll be so sure it's spinning counter-clockwise,
that the idea it could be spinning in the opposite direction will seem
impossible to you. But if you stare at it long enough, and intently enough, you
can make it spin the other way.

I've noticed the same phenomenon with political views.

People on the left think that anyone on the right is a lunatic, and everyone on
the right thinks the same thing about the left. I, as most people do, lean in
one direction politically, so naturally any comment I see coming from my side
seems reasonable to me. In fact, it seems impossible that a reasonable person
could think any other way. But since I grew up in a family that leaned in the
opposite direction, and I shared their same mindset in my younger days, I can
now draw on that experience, and I can take a political tweet that everyone on
my side thinks is insane, and I can stare at it, and just as with the spinning
dancer, I can flip it in my head so it seems reasonable.

To me, it's a testament to the power of the tribal instincts within us. We think
it's the other side that's crazy, but we're all under the same spell. ‚Öô

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mSeems like after a party has been around for longer than any living person, they

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mSo the average citizen hasn't had a positive outcome within reach for a while.

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mI saw agreement from both sides that a wet dishrag could defeat Trump if only
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0m270 electors represent voters who just plain dislike or hate him. Conversely it

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mNeither strategy can offer anything to the majority of the citizens in the
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mpolitical middle, the true average citizen, since turnout has been driven by
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mfear not opportunity.

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mBuilding a coalition from a carefully-crafted extreme attention-getting

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthe middle 50 percent of voters which is how it was supposed to be at a minimum.
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mSo once the issues and/or personalities representing them have reached full
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mpolarity, 50 becomes more of a constant to be converged upon from afar rather

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0msignificant overlap), the latter of which is the core of the majority that all
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mparties are supposed to be treating as constituents.
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mBut the core of the majority in the middle doesn't have a voice because they
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mdon't have any party which represents them any more, the parties are doing other

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mThe party gets more votes over the long run by fear-mongering against the other

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mresources can be justified which might actually benefit the majority of
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mcitizens.
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mProblem is, the majority are voting against their own best interest because
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mtheir own best interest has not been available for a number of cycles. Rather
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0meach side votes against what's perveived as the other's best interest instead,
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0msince that's the only thing at stake anyway.
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mSo the majority of voters end up speaking for the entire population as designed,
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mbut all votes are cast against someone's best interest because the minority
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mparty is voting exactly the same as the majority in this regard.
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mSo it's unanimous by both parties that as few of the average citizens as
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mpossible should have their best interest be served, and to redefine democracy in
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthat direction can not be accomplished during a single cycle or maybe not even

OK, so the transition from Make America Great Again slogan to Make America
Decent Again (and Better) reality is inevitable and welcome. It is easy to get
overjoyed by results of the U.S. Presidential Election (and some celebration
certainly is in order).

Uniting the country is definitely a commendable goal, though it is easier said
than done. The election results across all levels clearly illustrate just how
divided and polarized this land is. Thus, it will take quite a lot of time and
effort to see a reasonable progress on this front. We all can play our part in
it by a polite and constructive dialog with opponents and first finding common
ground on such pressing and all-encompassing issues as coronavirus pandemic,
environmental protection, social justice and health care reform.

In the meantime, let us not forget that, in order to restore the heavily damaged
moral fabric of this country, relevant measures should pass through the
Congress. And while Democrats retain control of the House, the opposing party
might retain control of the Senate. Which most certainly will lead to a
significant gridlock in moving forward with the democratic and, in some cases,
progressive agenda unless Democrats retake control in the Senate. Remember,
[3mwinning a battle is not a guarantee for winning a war[0m. That is why the U.S.
Senate run-off elections in Georgia to be held on January 5
([34mgeorgia.gov/vote-2020-runoff-elections[0m) are crucial.

[This has been hinted at in various threads but I'm stating it clearly here]

A fundamental cause of political polarisation is social media. Tech platforms
incentivised by advertising to increase engagement have (probably mostly
inadvertently) become manipulation engines that have destabilised democracies.

I think at this moment in time the tech community should take pause to consider
what we have done. We started with heady ideals and hopes, especially for the
internet, but we have veered a long way from that vision.

As engineers, we have great power in this world. For the foreseeable future, our
skills will be highly in demand and shape the future of humanity, in every area
of society - from finance to health, from entertainment to politics.

If you work for a social media company, or a search engine, or any company that
is reliant on adtech or high engagement for its income, then I implore you to
think long and hard about how your actions may have contributed to bringing us
to this point, and whether it is possible to change the course of your
organisation or it would be better to leave.

More positively, the large social media networks are now entrenched
corporations, and they have lost the advantages that startups confer. With
sufficient imagination and hard work there are many opportunities to disrupt
those companies with the compelling mission of making the world a better, not a
worse, place.

It's amazing. My friends on the left think the only reason for voting trump is
racism, and friends on the right think the only reason for voting biden is
socialism.

Where did all the intellect go?

The social dilemma documentary I think is very useful. It feels like social
media bubbles are a large component, although of course there have been many
contentious elections in the past.

Being centrist I can relate to parts of both sides but my experience is they
both dislike centrists.

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mAnd Republicans, on the other hand, who think Biden is a socialist are

Biden‚Äôs focus ought to be making sure a crazy person like Trump is never elected
again and that if he is, that government institutions cannot be abused the way
they were under Trump.

It should be made easier to prosecute a president for illegal activity.

Things like showing tax returns should be formalized.

New regulation needs to be put in place to limit the spread of falsehoods and
conspiracy theories over facts.

Social media currently benefit economically from this and that has to stop. The
economic incentive to spread crazy and extremist ideas has to be removed.

What saddens me, is that by the standards of corporate world Trump didn't do
anything extraordinary. He was running a country in a style of a mediocre
corporate executive. Same type of an executive that, for example, resulted in
The Boeing Company suffering losses and having fleets grounded. But nothing
special, really. Think "Uber" type of a corporate culture. Or "WeWork". Used to
run a country.

It is no wonder, the likely result is 400k+ deaths and a worst downturn in a
century. And one doesn't need to look further than Taiwan or South Korea, to see
that it was not inevitable and preventable by good governance.

A wish for good governance. Less cynicism. And a shift of culture in both

One of the things this election, and the last four years, has shown me, is the
impact of technology on our political discourse. It hasn't been a "good"
insight.

Federal Election records indicate that the leadership of technology companies
overwhelmingly supported a set of values that their employees appear to just as
overwhelmingly reject. That dissonance is really quite remarkable.

I see one of the fundamental challenges facing the new administration is how to
address this. I am not a fan of government regulation, more of a "let the
markets decide" kind of guy. I recognize however there is a systemic risk where
the technology "owner" can exploit it to harm society in a way that was
previously impossible.

While the country has focused on disinformation and hate speech, consider a
company that controls, in real time, the self-driving software in a car. Such a
technology, if weaponized, to could kill hundreds of thousands of people. Or it
could be weaponize to kill select people who were in the intersection of riding
in a self-driven car and in disfavor by the company that really controls that
car.

Early on in my career I chose not to work for military contractors who were the
"big" employers in Los Angeles at the time I graduated from college. They were
clearly engaged in finding clever, or at least more effective, ways to kill
people and that wasn't where I wanted to spend my time. But what about someone
working on self driving? It saves lives by avoiding some of the things end up
resulting in crashes. But it also provides an opportunity for great evil.

Do we trust the person in charge to not be evil? Companies change and while they
might declare their intentions when they are growing, what happens when they are
on top? Sometimes those quaint notions get cast aside when being a little bit
evil makes what you're trying to do that much easier or maybe that much more

What is the appropriate response, in a democracy, to a small number of people
controlling a potential weapon that can destroy that democracy? Sadly this is no
longer an idle question.

I don't have any answers here, just more questions.

"On election night, it was unclear who had won, with the electoral votes of the

Skimming through this thread, it certainly verges on flame - but I'd just like
to remind you all that officially, Biden hasn't won yet. Several (not all) media
outlets have called the race, and it sure looks like he will; but the elections
haven't yet been certified. With the coming legal challenges, it looks a lot
like 2000. Patience.

The sentiment of mutual understanding accross polticial lines expressed in many

However, let's not forget that on election night the current US president
clearly proved his staunchest critics right.

What might have happened if Fox News had adopted his "stolen election"
narrative?

This is, quite literally, how autocratic strongmen destroy their countries for

I've always felt that the Trump presidency served as an effective form of "Chaos
Engineering". Regardless of your views of Trump's politics, his administration
and method of leadership has exposed a lot of flaws in how our government has
been designed and engineered.

The postmortem of the last 4 years should be analyzed deeply in order to
identify the weak points in the infrastructure of our government in order to
make improvements.

Thanks for the valiant attempts to keep this discussion from devolving into a
full-fledged dumpster fire.

1. The US, by the most generally accepted definition, has had continuous
governance as a democracy since 1788. Just one more election, and not the most
contentious or momentous by a long shot.

2. Current reported spread in votes between D and R are pretty slim, 75.0M v.
70.7M Wikipedia 11PM EST 11/7.

3. Whatever your partisan opinion, at least 70M American adults, 48.5% of those
voting, disagree with you and think you‚Äôre an idiot. Try not to confirm the fact
with your comments.

4. Challenging the validity of the voting process is a time-honored tradition
during tight races. Stop sounding like newbies. This is the only time that the
validity of the electoral process gets enough visibility to figure out if
anything‚Äôs broke. Seriously broke? See 1.

5. A paper trail is a beautiful thing.

6. And what a wonderfully fertile field these comments are for use as examples
of propaganda, inflammatory rhetoric and logical fallacies. Wish I was teaching
a course right about now. Timely for the application of manure on fields too‚Ä¶

7. It would be nice if the mods kept the discussion away from an
r/politics-ization of HN. The sides are pretty obvious and enforcing an
arbitrary quota of half blue hurrah/half red hurrah would lead to a better flow
and balance. Heavy-handed, but appropriate in these few cases IMHO.

The brilliant, stupid, wise, foolish, angry, mellow, old, young, rich, poor,
naive, cynical, kind, nasty, sophisticated, brutish American people have spoken.
Whether you agree with the results or not, it‚Äôs a beautiful thing.

A voting system needs to be accurate but it also needs to inspire confidence. I
think the U.S. failed on the latter point. Let me be clear that I don't think
this affected the [3moutcome[0m, only the [3mconfidence in the outcome[0m.

Mail-in voting has existed for a long time, but it is being done at a larger
scale and in new ways and new places. It was a mistake to do it during such a
contentious election. Covid is not a good enough reason: it's easy enough to
drop the ballot in a county box so the secretary of state has a chain of custody
for all valid ballots. I would actually prefer voter ID as well as people
standing there to do a brief check. In addition to preventing fraud, it also
helps remind voters if they forgot to sign or something.

Also, I think it needs to be said that a lot of people hate Trump. Hate can
cause people to do things that they would never imagine doing otherwise, like
election fraud. It doesn't need to be a conspiracy‚Ä¶ just a lot of individuals
doing small stuff (post office employees throwing away likely Trump ballots,
etc.).

And it doesn't help that the map looked quite red on the day of the election,
and that the poll numbers were WAY off, and that the media was rooting for
Biden. It all just erodes confidence.

We should trust but verify the results. The basis of facts should be settled in
the following:

1. Select all ballots that were sent to the same address - or sent to the same
Post Office (grouping all PO Boxes by post office).
^ Here you are trying to see if there is systemic voting behaviors out of the
ordinary ‚Äî i.e. did 10+ ballots go to one address.

2. Select all ballots that were sent to an alternate address than the voter
registration.
^ This is a general query ‚Äî select a sample set of these and confirm with the
registered voter that they did indeed receive a mail in ballot.

3. If above is inconclusive, select all registered voters that requested a mail
in ballot against the 2017-2018 Equifax Data to determine if correlations occur.

4. Select all ballots that were the voter did not vote in the last X elections
(there are political consultancies that provide information on who NOT to waste
your time on because they do not vote), did these people request a mail in
ballot? Were these ballots sent to an alternate address?

For clarification [[31m1[0m], if one were armed with a SSN or DL and a previous
address, one could request a ballot on behalf of another person AND have that
ballot redirected to a location of their choosing‚Ä¶ including a PO Box. The form

The country may be divided. But those divisions are manufactured and exacerbated
over the last 4 years by a made-for-TV president.

I couldn't help but think, in looking at various TV news channels this past
week, that this is all sport. Big numbers on the score board and the
play-by-play constantly flashing on the screens. We're the spectators, and the
politicians are players on the field. Trump played the field better than anyone.

I hope that a new president and a new administration can show the USA that the
division is not as deep and worrisome as is portrayed. We're actually all
rooting for the same things here.

From a long way away, and well clear of the slings and arrows that Americans are
suffering, I would like to take a fleeting moment to wish you all well.

I do think that after such a president it behoves the winners of this election
to have a long hard think as to why the result was so close.

Your nation's people deserve a rest from the division you are suffering. Go well
and take the opportunity to set a course that is both good for you and worthy of
your immense wealth and power.

Being a centrist, I can definitely understand the desire for more conservative
policies, and a rejection of more liberal policies. What has been tough for me
personally, though, is to see a person as amoral as Trump get so much support. I
DO agree that Trump has done some good things, things that before him neither
the left nor the right was willing to do in a substantial way (mainly his
forcing a re-evaluation of our relationship with China). But his utter (and
ongoing) disregard for our democratic system, his incessant lying, the fact that
all he cares about is loyalty to him but gives no loyalty in return, the insane
narcissism, treating the Justice Dept. like his personal legal firm, etc.,
etc.. I just find it disgusting on every level.

That said, the recent Sam Harris podcast really helped me understand his appeal.
And I hope (but am not hopeful) that the left tries to mend their ways by
refraining from pushing (mainly white, straight men, but also others, like the
religious) many further from the Democratic party.

For a site full of engineers I'm surprised to see the discussion center on
partisan politics, talking points, unsourced claims and demands for sources,
bickering over every detail, when what I'd want to talk about among technical
people is the fact that Biden hasn't actually won, based on the rules of the
system. He claimed he won. So did Trump. Neither are backed by anything
tangible, yet. It looks like the PA AG has called for a statewide audit of
votes, several court orders have been issued in several states, including
Michigan and Wisconsin, there are lawsuits in several jurisdictions, and
recounts in Georgia and Nevada are going to start soon. Notice how I'm not
saying the lawsuits and accusations are founded, because I'd like to talk about
the system.

This is far from over. You could have votes invalidated. This is only over when
the electors travel to DC and 270+ vote for one person. That could be halted.
You could see the house delegations vote, you could see state or federal courts
rule, you could even see some state legislative bodies make decisions on it.

It takes a lot more than a claim of victory and a news organization calling it
for an election to be over, and I'd expect a bunch of very smart people to know
that.

As a european outsider I see big social media (Twitter, FB, Reddit etc.) as the
loser here, no matter the president.

- Dems already hated them because they were "complying" with the right/far
right. Not enough removal, deplatforming etc.

- Reps also hated them because of all the removal and deplatforming, "free
speech" problems etc. Then HN replies with the "They are a private company so
they can do whatever they want" > which leads the conundrum when Google banning

I'm glad we got Trump out of the white house. But I'm still skeptical.

The growing divide and threat of civil war ( not going to happen btw ) are
nothing compared to what will happen in the next 50 years of we do not have a
green new deal.

Climate change, and its little brother over fishing and unchecked exploitation
of our environment, is an existential threat to the human race. Bernie took it
seriously. Warren took it seriously. I'm not convinced the new establishment
takes it seriously. We need radical action YESTERDAY. More business as usual is
not going to cut it.

Furthermore, the new administration doesn't believe in Medicare for all. They
plan to do nothing about the currently broken system which causes 40% of people
who are diagnosed with cancer to spend their entire life savings and often go
bankrupt as a result of something that is not at all their fault.

Democrats down ballot got massacred, well progressive policies like
decriminalization of drugs, and raising the minimum wage passed with large
margins.

Trump claims to have engineered the world's greatest economy, but in fact he has

When you look at countries that are unified and act as a cohesive state such as
Switzerland, Korea, Norway, or Singapore, what they have in common is culture.

Los Angeles is nothing like Wichita. Beverly Hills is nothing like Miami.
Multiculturalism produces many great subjects such as art, food, music, dance,
poetry and great looking kids. But with amazing advantages comes equal
disadvantages. These include racial tensions, religious tensions, political
tensions, and gender identity strife.

Biden will probably fail at unifying our country though I hope not. How do you
unify those who appreciate civil war monuments and "Dukes of Hazard" reruns with
BLM supporters and Cardi B music videos?

The only way the United states would come together would be by way of a terrible
unifying threat that scares the hell out of the nation or a "Grand White Swan"
payout like universal basic income.

My biggest concern is how seemingly so many conservative people are becoming
huge conspiracy theorists. I don't mean normal conspiracy theories like there
being something more behind the JFK assassination, but like QAnon, Bill Gates
injecting people with microchips, Pizzagate, etc. A lot of people in my own
family in a rather backwards state believe that stuff. It's making me completely
lose faith in this country and I'm seriously considering getting out because of
this widespread idiocy.

How do you even begin to "meet in the middle" or have reasonable conversations
with people who believe in that stuff?

        [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mWhat's one to do in face of such situation? Do we expect that the "news media"

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mskeptical of the intentions of Bill Gates on the topic. For example, Bill Gates
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mhad quite an extensive relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, something a cursory
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0msearch on the topic from mainstream sources will give nothing more than a

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mindustry in India, one worth digging into. On the "microchip" thing, another
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mgreat example. Gate's related foundations and companies have openly talked about
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthe quantum dot system, which is just readable markers to identify who has had
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0ma particular vaccine, and have actively partnered with the pentagon and darpa,

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mpeople in Austin, TX already. Those kinds of assocation alone are enough to at

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mmicrochips story are coming from. So while it's untrue that the Gate's linked
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mprograms intend to put microchips in, the talk of digital certificates linked to
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mbiometrics such as quantum dot scare people, and then combine that with the

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mGiven the huge amount of propaganda being heaped on the American public from all

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mfallen victim to that propaganda, and instead should focus on the purveyors and

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mjudging of people in the current day to be very unprincipled also. We can invade

I don't think I realized just how much this was wearing on me. I know there's
steps to go before this is irrefutable, but the weight lifted is palpable and I
didn't really think it would be given how many troubles we still face. I
sincerely hope this is a step towards a healthier country. And for those that
did not like Trump, but weren't thrilled with Biden, I hope Biden is a stepping

I'd like to open a slightly different topic here which stems though from the
elections of the past 20 years. Wouldn't be a big take away now the reform of
the Elector College and the shift to a direct vote from the people ?

As a nonUS citizen from a country in which the head of state is being elected
directly from the people, I find it very unsettling that there have been cases
in which the president in US elections was running behind in popular votes and
by a big amount of votes, which almost happened here. I've tried to research it
a bit but I couldn't still understand why especially since the House and Senate
members are elected by popular vote already

I'd appreciate any insights here

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mrepresent the collection of people from all states - both concepts were

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthat each state (and the people from that state as a sub-population) deserve

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mNone of this is an argument for or against the Electoral College, nor should it

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mAs originally defined, the House of Representatives was the only piece of the

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mto represent the states, not the people directly.
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mThe Electoral College was an intermediary to represent both the states and the
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mpeople - as a compromise, it has many failings that seem obvious today. There is
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mno federal mandate as to how a state's electors choose to cast their votes.
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mEach state is responsible for regulating its own voting - this includes how
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mpeople vote and how electors are chosen and how those electors vote. It is mere
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mhappenstance that the majority of states have a winner-takes-all allotment
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mstrategy for their electors. Maine and Nebraska notably assign their electors
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mproportionally.
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mIt is also interesting to note that the tie-breaking mechanism for an Electoral

Something that should be addressed as soon as possible is reducing the capacity
of foreign actors to influence politics through organized trolling.

There has been a lot of gaslighting around this issue, but the fact is that the
United States has been protected by two vast oceans for its entire history, but
it opened a conduit into its heartland for foreign mischief-makers through
Facebook and Twitter. Whether it helped Trump or not in 2016 (frankly, I think
it probably did but it's exhausting to debate this so I won't) it does represent
a gaping hole in America's defenses.

Until this election, there seemed to be a clear pattern (in the English speaking
world anyway) that allowed one to reliably predict the winner of an election by
seeing which side the trolls supported.

There are no First Amendment protections for Russian/Iranian/Macedonian click or
troll farms. Detecting VPNs and other attempts to conceal traffic is not an
insurmountable technical challenge, yet it isn't done consistently.

The seductive "Arab Spring" approach to letting free speech run rampant on
social media turned out to be a mirage. Not only was the Arab Spring reversed in
Egypt, based on my discussions with Egyptians, Facebook was turned into a tool
of repression after the counter-revolution took hold.

(Yes, the irony of posting this from a throwaway account doesn't escape me, but
there's a difference between clearly anonymous speech, and speech that
misrepresents its source).

Biden will be the First Democrat since Grover Cleveland to take office without a
Democratic Senate. The House majority is smaller. So his mandate is effectively
toast. Another interesting historical fact. America has never elected 4
consecutive 2 term presidents. If Trump would have been elected it would have
been the first time in US history that this has happened. This election wasn't a
blue wave by any means, Trump underperformed House Republicans in many swing
states implying this was more of a personal decision rather than political.

Venetian Doge (political leader, not meme-canine). The house should definitely
be random selection- preferably all citizens over 18 and under say 70 filing a
tax return. B) Allow indefinite run-offs with None-of-the-above options.
Basically, if None-of-the-above wins, the election is redone but nobody on the

Please permit me a ramble, there are too many points to fit in a hn box and I'm
typing on a phone.

I'm sure our stateside friends would be happy to acknowledge that US politics
has a major effect on the whole world. I have had it pointed out to me before,
however, that the USA can vote in whomever they please, and it is none of our
business.

But American companies sell us our books and films (understatement), take cuts
of our credit card payments, make us coffee, organize our taxis. All of this
seems to be with preferential tax treatment. All of these things could be done
without the US, but the US is our partner in peace, so it is tolerated.

And here is the rub, this works so long as the USA is a legitimate ally.

And then came Trump, telling us that we don't spend enough on Nato (with US
defence companies) and threatening our peace. I believe this has lead to a
situation where the US is seen less as a partner and more as a bully, a colonial
overlord demanding tribute. I think the next 20 years will see a shift in this
kind of trade to the EU and to the East.

The USA can be insular if it wants, but it can't do so and expect everything to
be the same as it has been for the last 50 years. An insular US is a declining
US. Your new President has a terrific amount of work to do to undo this damage‚Ä¶

My concern is the mass talk of voter fraud shows how distrustful a great deal of
Americans are to their own democratic system. I'm ok with placating the fears
people have of election fraud and investigating, given the studies done, it's
quite certain voter fraud is a prime example of misinformation.

2016-2020 has been a time of seeing just how dangerous misinformation is in the
world of mass social media. All it takes is the spreading of false rumors
through various means of the internet and social media for people to lose their
minds and question their own democracy. I think both social media, advertising
agencies, and the modern media is largely responsible for this. Also, us in the
tech industry, who have over these last 4 years began to see the truly ugly side
of what we're building. In our constant need to hit KPIs, drive up SEO rank,
drive virility, we've slowly fed a monster that is now making itself known, and
disrupting the very fabric of democracy.

This election was so polarizing I am very afraid the country can recover from
it.

I am worried enough we have bug out bags packed, with critical documents, as I
expect this could easily escalate to a civil war as both sides are convinced
they are right; and more worrisome is that the other side is so completely
corrupted that they are not Americans or humans and should be taken out like the
trash.

We have Trump who will not concede and will fight this to his last moment; and
then will continue to fight it from the side lines.

We have AOC on twitter asking people to send names for her registry of Trump
supporters for future retribution. You know who else kept such lists? Hitler,
Mao, Mussolini.

Really scary times down here. Much worse than when Trump won in 2016.

The US needs all the help, prayers, and luck it can muster right now to find
it's way through this.

As a Canadian, what stands out for me about the last two elections is that many
Americans seem to desperately want a variety of political reforms, but neither
party seems interested in providing them. Trump and Sanders both sold themselves
as reform candidates in 2016, but only Trump wound up on the ticket.

Sanders might be the real deal, but he's not going to represent a major party
until donation and campaign spending limits (like we have in Canada) reduce
corporate influence on U.S. politics. Sanders scares away the "big money" that
U.S. elections depend so heavily on.

Trump has not proven to be a reform candidate in any sense of the word. As a
political outsider with control over both the house and senate for his first two
years in office, he had the power to deliver meaningful reforms, but didn't.
Americans desiring reform [3mshould[0m have felt deeply betrayed by Trump's first
term.

The democrats had a smoother primary in 2020, but decided on an utterly bland
candidate. Biden is a return to the status-quo. I predicted that, after the last
four years, a return to the status quo would appeal to many, but this election
proves otherwise. This [3mshould[0m have been an [3measy[0m slam dunk for the Democrats to
win, but it's turned out to be a squeaker!

If the democrats ride the status quo for the next four years and both parties
were to run the same candidates again, I suspect Biden would lose. The Democrats
need to pay attention to what Americans want.

I would suggest that Biden's administration should, despite running on a
thoroughly status-quo platform, [3membrace[0m reform. Too many Americans mistrust
their own political system, to the point that they're willing to picket polling
stations because they think fraud is being committed. That must be fixed.
Finding ways to reduce the influence of money on politics (e.g. campaign
spending limits) would be a good start. It will also be an easy sell to devolve
and distribute some of the powers that have accumulated in the white house over
the last several decades. If you're not comfortable with some of the powers
Trump wielded during his time in office, then perhaps those powers shouldn't
rest with the POTUS.

Bottom line, if the democrats try to pretend Trump [3mnever[0m happened and [3mcouldn't[0m
happen again, they're in for unpleasant surprises.

When I was growing up, Conservatives were the ones much more proud of US
institutions, like the courts, universities, and even the free media, while
Liberals and Leftists such as Chomsky were always criticizing these
institutions, e.g. the media in the book Manufacturing Consent. (They criticized
it as being too much a mouthpiece of the government.)

I find it interesting that four years of Trump's usual blame-shifting, together
with his fan base, has resulted in Trumpists blowing way past the Leftists in
their distrust of all US institutions. This is far beyond the Tea party's
displeasure with government spending. Sure, Republicans distrusted scientists
before, but now Trump supporters distrust the following for partisan reasons:

Media

Polls

Election

Scientific establishment

Medical establishment [[31m1[0m]

Universities

Courts (so-called judges[[33m2[0m], Mexican heritage[[32m3[0m] etc.)

FBI

CIA

IRS

and much more.

Are the institutions perfect? No. Is there fraud and corruption? Sure, but
comparing to other countries relatively little, and probably less than in the
past. But destroying Americans' trust in these institutions can be dangerous. I
can understand dissidents doing it, but the President?

The division will not be fixed until they realize that the division is not
ideological.

Most of these comments imply that the division is just ideological. I guess
everyone here is so financially well off as to never having been too poor to
afford health insurance but just above the cut off to get free health insurance.
Families with kids and high living costs, and then being forced to pay over
$2000 as penalty for not affording healthcare, it broke many spirits.

It was the ACA "Individual Responsibility Mandate" and it is the reason why all
the hispanics in Florida without health insurance that I know, voted for Trump
in 2016--because he said he'd get rid of that depressing $2000+ fine. Which he
finally did.

Simple as that, and certainly not as idealistic as these comments imply. Those
who don't see that did not have to pay that ACA "Individual Responsibility
Mandate" while being poor in an expensive city.

A "new direction for divided US" would mean that these politicians stop
pretending people vote idealistically versus based on finances. Reading these
other comments, one would think all the brown Floridians who voted for Trump are
white supremacists. I thought Hacker News was above that simplistic rhetoric.

From this point to Dec 14th we're likely to see some interesting legal
proceedings before the supreme court, such as whether or not ballots received
without a postmark after election day can be legally counted (this might have

Twitter and Facebook could follow. Increasing friction to post/repost, more fact
checks, more labels on misinformation, and better localized moderation in
general should be something these companies should have a good handle on
already, but it seems like they've barely started grasping the problems.

It almost seems like if this isn't tackled head on instead of being ignored,
that there might be scant progress on other issues like climate change.

I think we should thank the people who counted the votes, all of them, but
especially the ones in those "battle ground" places who had to feel a lot of
pressure and had to work in difficult circumstances during a pandemic. Thank you

Leaving Trump aside for the moment, the last four years have shown up how
fundamentally undemocratic the US is.

No one ever expected Trump to get more votes than Biden. Even the Republicans
were well aware of this. In fact, 7 of the last 8 Presidential elections have
ended with a Democrat getting more votes than a Republican.

Yet even with a 3.5 million vote lead, the perception was the election was on a
knife edge.

This is ridiculous. The EC is an anachronmism and needs to be abolished. It made
sense when it was established, but it's clearly not working.

Same for the Senate. [3m70% of people are represented by 30% of Senators[0m.

Here is a simplifying view: In the US there are some people, less than 1% of the
voting population, who have a lot of power and control of a lot of money and are
looking to the political system to make more money.

This less than 1% do disagree among themselves, and that disagreement is the
fundamental source of essentially all the political fighting.

For the other 99+%, there isn't much to fight about.

What the other 99+% want can be summarized in one word ‚Äî [3mmore[0m. For more detail,
they want the two biggies, peace and prosperity. For more, they want "life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness", financial and emotional security, love,
home and family, good health, happy, successful children. There's not a lot to
fight about there.

So, again, the fighting is from the less than 1% who want to use their money and
power to get more money.

Of course, way more than 1% of the voting population are highly concerned about
politics, are fighting, but, sorry, guys, they are foot soldiers, pawns, for the
less than 1%.

As an example, let's take one of the issues, say, health care. Glancing at
history, US health care has come a long way since the lone country doctor with a
one horse carriage. In terms of current US medicine, he was not very good.
Point: Health care has changed a lot and is still changing, rapidly. So, what
solution we come up with should accommodate such change.

Health care can be really expensive, and we need a solution for that. We need in
some sense to [3mlevel out[0m the costs, make them predictable. Ways have been private
medical insurance, health care membership organizations, and government
provided health care.

So, here are the main concerns: Private health insurance is too expensive for a
major fraction of the population, so those people look to other options. Then
for the other options, concerns are quality of care (it might be too cheap and
not very good ‚Äî loved ones could die), waiting times, and big tax increases.
Point: These are all issues, but some examples can show that we should be able
to do quite well on all the issues of quality, waiting times, costs, etc., well
enough that we should not have much to fight about.

And there has been the issue of private insurance and "pre-existing" conditions.
We can all agree that it would be nice for private insurance companies to ignore
such data, conditions. And the richer US states did have laws forcing the
insurance companies to so ignore. But maybe now the US is wealthy enough to so
ignore for everyone. Hopefully. So, we can all agree or nearly so. Not much to
fight about.

So, what is the cause of the the fighting? With some approaches and situations,
for less than 1% of the voting population, there is or can be a lot of money
involved, or a lot of power and then a lot of money.

My view is that we can go down the list of main political topics and conclude
the same ‚Äî for 99+% of the voters, there's not much to fight about except some
people, less than 1%, want to fight to make money, big money.

But for various policies, operations, programs, etc., it really is possible just
to make a mess, to create waste. At least the 99+% can be against the waste!

E.g., for the [36m$trilions[0m W and Obama spent on Gulf War II, was that from (a)
people who were in line to make money from the effort or (b) just waste? I'd
say, some of (a) but mostly (b). Point: Not all the issues are about the less
than 1% seeking money and, instead, there can also be ordinary waste.

Bottom line: The 99% should throttle the less than 1%, settle differences, and
get on with life.

It's pretty remarkable though that almost half of the US voted for someone who
is clearly unsuitable to be president based on his first term.

It might be time to consider letting go of the democratic ideal that every

voting eligibity or vote weight that would mostly exclude or give little weight
to the votes of people who voted for a clearly unsuitable candidate.

What kinds of investments can one make to capitalize on a Biden victory? For
example:

* If Biden will be weak on China, do we expect Chinese tech companies to perform
well and if so, how can we get exposure to that? Some China tech ETF?

* Biden will likely support a lot of green endeavors, and so Green ETFs could be
a good BUY.

* If there is a blue sweep, then there could be a massive stimulus, which would
mean lots of money slushing around in the market. Maybe QQQ is a good BUY.

The media was way too cautious in making the call here, but it's easy to
understand why when the Republicans made it so difficult to count absentee
ballots before election night, likely to benefit their candidate through the
confusion of swinging red and then blue.

If you don't want this to happen again, pressure your red representatives to

No: he hasn't, and that's confusing to both "the world" as well as waaay too
many Americans: the election isn't until mid December, when the electoral
college casts its votes. You didn't vote for the president, you voted for what
your state will try to vote for in December. Unfortunately, state
representatives in the presidential election are not universally required to
vote along the state election result, and while rare in the past, the current
administration is clearly not above bribery and criminal endeavours to get what
they want, when they need it.

(Of course, if that's news to you, then you're probably not in the US right now)

Biden is PROJECTED to win the White House, because that's how US elections work.
It looks for all the world that he'll win, but he [3mmight not[0m depending on the
electoral college: you don't win because the most people voted for you. That's

And before someone goes "what are the odds": this isn't 2016 when people still

exploits, and literal criminal behaviour to draw on. Until elected by the
electoral college, Biden [3mhas not won[0m. And remember that many states merely put a
monetary fine on being a faithless electors: it's not even illegal. $1000 to
pick the guy who'll pay you back bigger, instead of who the state voted for?
Scandalous! But also: entirely legal.

The division and basically legal corruption are my concerns.

On a basic level, we are all people and all run the same basic way, and have the
same basic needs.

One layer up, we are Americans. Those of us who travel, or who communicate
outside the domestic US, see many other nations and often a higher degree of
solidarity as citizens.

Looks like a priority problem to me.

We all need to earn enough to make it, or we all end up paying the costs
associated with chronic homelessness, for example.

We all need to see the doctor too.

Eating good food, and the other human basics are not hard to understand.

Often, I see "those other people" type arguments of various kinds too.

Lazy people. Different colored people. Weird people. Other people; namely, not
people like us, or not in our tribe, group, and‚Ä¶

Ordinary people do not have very effective representation. Money talks. And it
should, but that brings me back to priorities again.

No judgement, no blame here. Just observations.

I submit resolving these things to a more harmonious body politic is on us
people. I am not convinced anyone, or entity can just swoop in and improve
things.

That is just where we are today.

One other observation:

Nations older than us have been where we are. Their peoples have had to do the
work to get past it, and have had to do that multiple times.

This tells me we aren't experiencing anything fundementally new, in human terms.

But it is new to America. New in the sense of the USA being young enough, and
the pace of change in the world being rapid enough for the state of things to
feel new, or like doom, or, or‚Ä¶

Given the burden of improving on our current state lies with us as people,
citizens, I submit the following:

We all need to understand one another better. That starts by talking. Really
talking and listening. This is best done sans judgement, and with deliberate
intent to understand better.

We all are where we are in life, and we all have made choices, and relitigating
the past does not appear to hold answers for our future.

This is about what we do now. It is about our priorities as humans and Americans
too.

Take voting, for example.

People had the following options:

Vote Major Party

Vote other

No vote.

Everyone made their choice and had reasons, right?

If we apply the intent to seek understanding of one another and avoid judgement,
that means having a talk about why people voted or no voted the way they did.

People no voting, often did so because they did not want to consent to, or
endorse, approve of what they see as ineffective, corrupt governance. Or they
did not connect a vote to a positive future for themselves and theirs.

Why is that? I think many, and include myself until recently, would rush to
judge and blame.

A vote for non major party X really is a vote for major party Y. Same for
staying home.

After talking some, the idea of candidates interviewing for a job comes up and
poor or toxic representation means not approving them for the job, and with that
we see lazy, or stupid aren't really valid as reasons why.

I will stop there, and urge you to think about how all of that is framed up as a
duty, or burden and how people may reject all of that in light of what they may
see as an irrational election.

Same goes for how people have voted or not before too. Those decisions are made,
cannot be unmade and people had their reasons for making them.

Notably, after some real discussion, the reality hits: we can't tell people to
approve of potential leaders, and we can't dictate what is best, nor their point
of view.

We can talk to them and understand what they need to cast a vote. We can attract
them to join a cause and all that too.

So why doesn't that happen more?

I submit this is a big part of the priority and mutual understanding and
consideration discussion we all need to have.

Without that talk being a fundamental part of our body politic, we appear to be
divided into factions, blocs who understand others, "those other people"
increasingly poorly as pressure to avoid the worst continues to rise.

With that discussion, it becomes much easier to see what we may consider an
obvious, rational choice, say lesser evil as an example, really is not so
obvious, or may even be harmful, not a lesser evil, but perhaps just a different
kind.

No matter how this all goes, at any given time our future is about the decisions
we make together, the actions we take together, and the outcome we live with
together.

The election is past us now, but please do consider it was about the votes
people were about to cast, not the ones they may have cast in the past.

Talking about all that is much easier and can be far more effective when people
are not also fending off negative, and frankly until we understand one another
better, uninformed personal judgements too.

We are divided to a harmful degree despite all of us having the same basic
humanity.

I urge you to talk, and I mean really talk with others very indifferent from
you, who live differently than you do and understand one another better.

I do not know how we get our priorities in order as people otherwise. And
without that, we rub the risk of our future continuing to be an increasingly
mixed bag for increasing numbers of us.

Finally, consider this idea:

When we make the discussion about what we oppose, it is not going to be about
what we need, or want that is good.

Think about trying to lead a team by only telling them what not to do. They will
get somewhere, and it won't be anything anyone opposed either.

We all benefit from an explicit, public good. That means the basics are in order
leaving people with free agency to get after better, or what they want.

Understanding one another better will make that explicit, public good more
clear.

It will improve our basic solidarity as people, reduce division.

I submit one final idea:

There will not be a net public good we all benefit from and depend on, unless we
make the discussion, body politic, about it.

And that is how I am playing it now, and have been for a while now.

I want and need to be voting FOR good, not AGAINST bad, or evil.

You probably do too, and I encourage you to make more of the discussion about
that explicit, public good and demand our leaders do the same things; namely,
understand the people they need votes from better, and to apply that
understanding to propose policy people can vote FOR, not just default to people
voting AGAINST the very worst.

that the unified Republican elite, along with > 35% of the electorate, is
fundamentally lawless and anti-democratic, and will do anything it can to cheat
its way into power. All three branches are implicated and have been for a while:
Bush v Gore in 2000, the US Attorney firings, Shelby County in 2013, the
refusal of the Senate to convict Trump in 2020, the disgusting anti-science
politicization of coronavirus, and so on. The scale of Trump‚Äôs personal
corruption is unique among Republican national figures, particularly in foreign
policy. But the racist authoritarianism and fundamental disrespect for elections
is a defining creed of the party.

One of the more unpleasant truth about democracy is that it‚Äôs quite fragile. In
any real sense, the US has only been a democracy since 1965. When large segments
of the population are ideologically opposed to democratic governance -
universal human rights, respecting fair elections, following the plain text of
the law, and so on - mechanisms by which democracy sustains itself begins to
fail.

One possibility is to amend the constitution to change first-past-the-post
voting in all local-to-federal elections, to let never-Trump types speak out
without facing electoral suicide, and to divert right-conservative attention
away from a single ‚Äúleader‚Äù figure. And obviously the electoral college needs to
go.

But the fact that more than 65 million people voted for Trump at all speaks to a
great sickness and nihilism in American culture. Trump himself might be put out
to pasture. But Trumpism existed before he got here, and it isn‚Äôt going
anywhere.

There are facts here. Things like Covid 19 and climate change are both real and
current or impending disasters. The "left" has solutions and the "right"

To me what this election (as well as the 2016 election) illustrates, is what a
poor set of choices we have had.

In no sane world should it have been difficult for the Democrats to defeat
Donald Trump in 2016. He had no history in political office, and he lost the
popular vote to just about the worst candidate the Democrats could have put up.
Had the Democrats put up [3manyone[0m who was less divisive than Hillary Clinton then
we are not where we are today.

Likewise this time around, nobody I have talked to seriously voted for Joe Biden
on his own merits. They voted for him because he's not Donald Trump. I have had
people tell me they don't care if there is fraud and cheating, it's worth it if
Trump is defeated. Put up someone with more genuine appeal and you not only get
the "anyone but Trump" vote but you get enough undecided votes that there isn't
any room for questioning the result.

We need better candidates who generate real support and appeal other than just
not being their opponent. Not sure how to get there.

The thing that will sit deep within me for at least the next few years is that,
no matter how you slice it, a vote for Trump is complicit acceptance of his
divisive and harmful behavior. Of course you don't need to be a racist to vote
for Trump, but you do need to fear the other options so much that you agree that
his behavior and the way that he represents our country to the rest of the
world is tolerable compared to what might come after him.

I was on the phone with my mom earlier and one of her friends called her up.
She's a republican, but they avoid politics. She asked her, genuinely afraid, if
she thought that Harris would steal the presidency and convert the country to
socialism. She's not an idiot. She's a physician, but was still so caught up in
fear mongering that she genuinely believed that the government would steal her
income and that there would be riots in the streets as we turn into a third
world nation. I'm going to think about her differently after hearing that.

This is probably the first time in my life where I am going to look at people
differently based on who they voted for and I hate that. However, I can't get it
out of my head that they voted for a president that has so disgraced the
highest office in our country and that they did it because of a fear of the
future burning so far inside them that they felt another four years of Trump was
preferable to even as bland of a change as a Biden presidency will be.

No worries - - Trump is now VESTED just like Joe Biden will be, and all the
decades of American Presidents before them. Trump will start "collecting" in
January .

All of them grant favors in return for the moolah - - it's just they have to
wait until after they get out of office to collect, speeches, book deals, highly
questionable but all legal.

Actually though, Joe may not make it 4 years, very unlikely, he already has

Biden is the hugest illusion in American politics. You will probably get very

One candidate supports separating children from their families for certain
groups of illegal immigrants, kept those children in cages for some time, and
has since lost track of around 500 of them; not reuiniting them with their
families. This has all been extensively documented.

And approximately seventy million people have voted for that candidate.

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mAgain, nobody "supports" keeping children in cages. (and do keep in mind that
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthese so-called "cages" were used by earlier administrations too) But consider
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthis situation: your country has a standing policy that when a refugee comes to
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0myour border, instead of turning them away, you let them in, you keep them in a
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mtemporary facility while you try to go through the legal process of evaluating
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mtheir asylum claims or whatever because your country also has a standing policy
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthat people just can't wander into the country unaccounted for. Most of the
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mtime, these two policies can be in harmony, but one day 20k people show up on
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0myour doorstep. Policy A says you don't turn them away, policy B says you don't
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mlet them loose into the country. What do you do? And I'm not talking about what

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mand cons. If the solution really were trivial and simple, we wouldn't argue

"Racist" mentioned in this thread dozens of times along with fascists all the
usual derogatory buzzwords. Communist and woke both worryingly have less
mentions considering the context. Bolshevism suprisingly has got no mentions
considering what the YCombinator Alumni Michael Simon tweeted and the platform
he set up.

Anywho, I digress. I believe those in here to be intelligent and educated so I
would ask you to take your partisan hats off for a minute if you're honest and
consider when AZ goes Trump this is the time for you to start freaking out.

The mainstream media has been extremely irresponsible and the forthcoming riots
when this is overturned are going to lay squarely on their feet. I would also
ask those of you who have a conscience to be less irresponsible than journalists
over these coming weeks until December in an attempt to reduce said damage.

I say this because if you think Biden is going to be your president you haven't
been watching carefully enough.

Also dang if you will please change the title. Biden hasn't won anything yet -
as you know the media doesn't declare winners esp not given their woeful conduct
and bogus calls (AZ), states have to certify before a winner is declared. Also
please ask PG to be more responsible with his tweets if he will listen. This
will reflect badly on all involved.

Thankyou.

Social media has been devoid of Covid fear mongering since election night. For

Why are they gone? Where did they go? There were waves of Covid stories for

where did the come from?

"Coivd will go away when the election is over" is shorthand for "The Democrats

Since the oil embargo of 73-74[[37m0[0m], which was caused by the 'Arab-Israeli War',
securing the oil supply from the Middle East has been a top priority of the US
government. The embargo highlighted how vulnerable the US was to the Middle
East. Since then, 'Peace in the Middle East' has been a plum goal of successive
US administrations. President Carter was able to get a peace agreement between
Israel and Egypt[[31m1[0m] which contributed to his ultimately winning a Nobel
prize[[33m2[0m].

Succeeding administrations failed to gain additional peace and instead leaned on
regime change in an attempt to oust unstable governments and seat US-friendly,
stable regimes. This approach failed in principle: Regime change itself did not
lead to stability. But instead, led to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and
ultimately, it was the protracted presence of US troops in those nations that
provided stability. That stability was paid for with the lives of US soldiers
put in harms way of militants from both within those nations and from outside of
them.

Under Obama, two threats emerged: ISIS and an emboldened Iran. ISIS went from a
'JV Team', to controlling an area the size of Pennsylvania, spanning Iraq and
Syria[[32m3[0m]. Iran was granted an agreement to suspend weapons-grade nuclear
research until 2031 [[34m4[0m]. Iran may or may not be complying with the agreement,
but it was known that they were causing instability throughout the Middle East,
funding ISIS, Hezbolah, and planning and funding ambush attacks on US troops
throughout the region[[36m5[0m].

This was the situation in January 2017.

Reviewing what the current administration has done since taking office, the
coordinated and deliberate steps, and the results, have been astonishing, given
the intractable and largely unsuccessful efforts to stabilize the region over
the last 50 years:

a. Established 'energy independence' by modifying US regulations on production
of oil, natural gas and coal. The US became a net exporter of energy, reducing
the leverage that the Middle East states have over the US[[35m6[0m].

b. Moved the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and recognize the Golan Heights
as Sovereign Israel territory. This worked to gain trust from Israel, improving
their willingness to participate in peace agreements. [[91m8[0m]

c. Coordinated with Russia to eliminate ISIS. It was completely eradicated,
including US Special Forces killing the leader and founder, Al-Baghdadi[[92m10[0m].

d. Withdrew from the Iran Nuclear accord, and renewed sanctions against Iran.
The funds provided by the accord likely were used in part to fund their terror
activities.

e. Killed General Soleimani, who was know to be the mastermind and source of
funding for terrorism throughout the Middle East, directed not just at US, but
other Arab States as well. [[97m7[0m] d. and e. illustrated to the Arab States that the
US was willing to take decisive action to quell the regional threat that Iran
posed.

f. Withdrew troops from Syria, extricating the US from that war zone, after ISIS
was defeated.

g. Begin withdrawing troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. Most Arab countries want
the US out so they can self-govern again.

h. With the above puzzle pieces in place, the administration rapidly concluded
peace agreements between Israel and three Arab states: United Arab Emirates,
Bahrain [[93m9[0m] and later, Sudan. Other countries are said to be joining soon.

i. Earned 2 Nobel peace prize nominations for the peace agreements (for 2021,
winners will be announced next September).

Reviewing this timeline, and the magnitude of this achievement, it's hard to
square the approach and its success against the claims of ineptitude leveled.

A lot of people here are talking about the "healing the division" but what if
the path forward is to figure out how to exist with the division? We need to
start getting more creative than just wishfully thinking this polarization is
going away anytime soon because news flash, it's not. So what is the step
forward?

A national divorce needs to start being talked about more seriously. It's at
least peaceful and amicable, and better than the other alternatives (civil war,
foreign conquerors, authoritarianism, etc).

This isn't "giving up" on the problems per say, but instead, accepting reality
and thinking of solutions going forward. Thinking the left and right can be
unified again is as wishful as thinking Artificial intelligence won't displace
anymore workers.

Politics aside, I would not wish a stressful job on [3many[0m 77 year old regardless

I don't know what motivates these decisions but it seems to me the people of his

they think the glory of being president, even if compromised is worth dying for,
or something else.

All of the reasons I can come up with strike me as misguided - 'president' is
not a mountain peak you reach with your dying breath, it is supposed to be a
difficult job of serving others.

If someone has a take on what his party/he is thinking that's other than

As a non-US citizen watching this from the outside, I'm divided between my
relief at American's not having to endure Trump's stupidity for another 4 years,
and some trepidation for world citizens on what a competent/active US president
will do w.r.t. foreign policy & proxy wars.

The perception is that Trump was too dump to start new wars and wasn't subtle -
so you could at least know what he's thinking w.r.t. your (non-American)
interests. On the other hand, most American presidents are nice & courteous at
face value while raining drone bombs on unsuspecting non-Americans, spreading
Freedom (with a capital F).

As a non-American, I would rather Americans endure a bit longer and the
remaining (7B-0.3B) world citizens have 4 more years of (relative) US
non-involvement. Selfish, I know, but the world needs a breather.

The republican party has no counterpart anywhere in the world. They are led by

I am convinced that the main problem in the US is the structure of the Senate.
It is preposterous to assert that the state of Rhode Island or the welfare state
of Kentucky is as important to the security or economic health of the nation as
California or Texas.

We are a divided nation: people trying to make the best of their situation, and
the Senate, a fantasyland where we pretend that every state is equally relevant.

The "2 per state" rule worked back in 1776 because the states were roughly the
same size, everyone was a farmer, and fertilizer had not yet been invented.

Today, senators should be allocated based on the GDP of each state.

How does HN feel about the call from AOC to compile lists of those who supported
or worked for or aligned with the Trump administration
([34mnypost.com/2020/11/06/aoc-facing-heat-for-wanting-to‚Ä¶[0m). Former Obama
administration staffer Michael Simon said that he is gathering the names of
anyone who supported Trump in the 2016 and 2020 election, and has created a
project for this ([34mmobile.twitter.com/trumpaccproject[0m).

This seems like the logical end of cancel culture and deplatforming, which is to
assemble a list of people and organizations to target or shame or blacklist. I
find this to be a very disagreeable suggestion given that people simply are
exercising their constitutional and political rights and this furthers division,
encourages extremism, and has a chilling silencing effect on civil discourse.

To me this reeks of authoritarian Leftism, like the violence seen in past
revolutions in China or Russia. There is also a great deal of irony as well,
since AOC and her supporters are certainly not calling for a blacklist of
Marxists, despite Marxism being the cause of over 100M deaths in the 20th
century.

No one has yet won. No one will have won the election until states certify their
counts. It'd be nice if the counts, and recounts, were already completed.
(Florida, of the "hanging chad" debacle, actually finished its count within
hours in this election. Why did these less populous states move so quickly, and
then slow down so much, once it became apparent who was winning? Scroll down on

[3mNo state[0m (out of all 50) has yet certified their count, and certainly no
battleground states have certified their counts. In fact, many of them have
still not even finished counting the votes.

To assert otherwise, over a weekend when none of the recounts or court cases are
resolved, is literally spreading misinformation that many of the same media
outlets are claiming to be stopping. Instead, they're shaping the narrative and
rushing to crown a victor so that it becomes a fait accompli.
