    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mseems. But for the vast majority it's much less of an issue than it is in the
    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mUS. For one thing, most people are not members of one of our federal
    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mpolitical parties. Local politicians don't even align with federal parties,
    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mnor do provincial ones in all cases. Many people will shift their vote

    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mBasically, for myself and most people I know, we vote for the party whose

    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mless polarized than in the US. And because it's a multi-party system, you can
    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mhave minority government that actually functions by garnering support of
    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mopposition parties. (We also effectively don't have multiple veto points

    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mhelps keep things from getting overheated.) Of course, the system isn't
    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mperfect. For instance by virtue of being both multi-party and first past the

  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mremembered the many wrong and harmful ideas that I recognized and rejected

  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mFor example, during Bill Clinton's impeachment trial for sexual harassment of

  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthat powerful men like to play around with women, and that the intern knew what
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mshe was getting into when she got the job working for him. Later, I realized
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthat I was wrong. Those beliefs enable sexual harassment of women across
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0msociety. We must reject those beliefs so women can have equal opportunity and

  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m

  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m

  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mEspecially when neither party has much to offer the average citizen any more,
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthey have built their strength traditionally on low voter turnout where extreme
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mfactions loudly broadcasting gradually become over-represented in the most
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mpolarizing way.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mAs cycles continue only the most polarizing issues drive the turnout, and for
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mturnout to grow beyond a certain point the majority of the potential voters
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mmust perceive the other party as a more serious threat, when compared to any
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0msecurity offered by their own party which they (might) have chosen because they
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mfound it less offensive (maybe only in past cycles too).
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mThe parties no longer need to have as much to offer the average citizen as
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mcycles go on, when they can get contending turnout from their own extremists
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mcombined with orders of magnitude more sympathizers who can be convinced to
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mstrongly fear what the _other side_ could take away.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mSeems like after a party has been around for longer than any living person,
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthey will not get support by having more to offer average citizens than in
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mprevious cycles, only by taking less away from them.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mSo the average citizen hasn't had a positive outcome within reach for a while.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mNow it's too late, these top candidates are realistically as youthful as you
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mcan get compared to the grand old parties themselves, and regardless of
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mpersonal integrity or leadership style can not offer anything above that from
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthe parties alone.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mEven in the case of Trump's extreme personality, which the Democrats did not
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0meven try to nominate a candidate having that feature, so this element was as
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mone-sided as you can get.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mI saw agreement from both sides that a wet dishrag could defeat Trump if only
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m270 electors represent voters who just plain dislike or hate him. Conversely it
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mwas recognized Trump would win if he had merely 270 electors of voters who
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mdislike or hate one or more of the current items on the Democratic party
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mplatform.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mNeither strategy can offer anything to the majority of the citizens in the
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mpolitical middle, the true average citizen, since turnout has been driven by
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mfear not opportunity.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mBuilding a coalition from a carefully-crafted extreme attention-getting
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mposition, and pushing hard from there so the other side ends up below the 50
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mpercent needed to be in power, has turned out to prevail over representing even
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthe middle 50 percent of voters which is how it was supposed to be at a
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mminimum.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mSo once the issues and/or personalities representing them have reached full
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mpolarity, 50 becomes more of a constant to be converged upon from afar rather
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthan a starting point to build a majority from in both directions.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mResulting in half the voters who turn out, and half the politically centrist
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mcitizens (which is a much larger group by a variable multiple of active voters)
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mwho will always be dissatisfied and these are two different groups (but having
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0msignificant overlap), the latter of which is the core of the majority that all
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mparties are supposed to be treating as constituents.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mBut the core of the majority in the middle doesn't have a voice because they
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mdon't have any party which represents them any more, the parties are doing
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mother things with the money and the concerns of centrist citizens are given
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mlowest priority.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mThe party gets more votes over the long run by fear-mongering against the other
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mside regardless of who the candidates are at the time, and only declining
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mresources can be justified which might actually benefit the majority of
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mcitizens.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mProblem is, the majority are voting against their own best interest because
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mtheir own best interest has not been available for a number of cycles. Rather
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0meach side votes against what's perveived as the other's best interest instead,
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0msince that's the only thing at stake anyway.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mSo the majority of voters end up speaking for the entire population as
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mdesigned, but all votes are cast against someone's best interest because the
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mminority party is voting exactly the same as the majority in this regard.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mSo it's unanimous by both parties that as few of the average citizens as
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mpossible should have their best interest be served, and to redefine democracy
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0min that direction can not be accomplished during a single cycle or maybe not
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0meven a single generation.

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0m1. Reality is often only reported in ‚Äúliberal‚Äù news sources. A lot of

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mand balance is not achieved by putting Mueller against a Trump surrogate.

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mexample, David Brooks and Ross Douthat write for the New York Times. There‚Äôs
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mno equivalent among the Wall St Journal columnists or Fox News hosts.

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mexample, reporting about the Michigan ballot glitch without mentioning that it

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mFundamentally, it‚Äôs not that we have differing information, it‚Äôs that we only
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0maccept information that confirms our world view. I can read dozens of articles

  [0m[This has been hinted at in various threads but I'm stating it clearly here]
  [0m
  [0mA fundamental cause of political polarisation is social media. Tech platforms
  [0mincentivised by advertising to increase engagement have (probably mostly
  [0minadvertently) become manipulation engines that have destabilised democracies.
  [0m
  [0mI think at this moment in time the tech community should take pause to consider
  [0mwhat we have done. We started with heady ideals and hopes, especially for the
  [0minternet, but we have veered a long way from that vision.
  [0m
  [0mAs engineers, we have great power in this world. For the foreseeable future, our
  [0mskills will be highly in demand and shape the future of humanity, in every area
  [0mof society - from finance to health, from entertainment to politics.
  [0m
  [0mIf you work for a social media company, or a search engine, or any company that
  [0mis reliant on adtech or high engagement for its income, then I implore you to
  [0mthink long and hard about how your actions may have contributed to bringing us
  [0mto this point, and whether it is possible to change the course of your
  [0morganisation or it would be better to leave.
  [0m
  [0mMore positively, the large social media networks are now entrenched
  [0mcorporations, and they have lost the advantages that startups confer. With
  [0msufficient imagination and hard work there are many opportunities to disrupt
  [0mthose companies with the compelling mission of making the world a better, not a
  [0mworse, place.

   [1mehsankia[0m [2m9 months ago[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mI absolutely agree this is an issue, but I honestly think it even transcends
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0msocial media algorithms. Well, for one thing, the news media is just as much to
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mblame, pushing clickbait and stories that induce the most rage. The next step
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mis, regardless of social media sites, people tend to share said stories far
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mmore, so it's a vicious circle. I think any large connected social media site,
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mregardless of the algorithms, will lead to a similar result.

   [1mThorncorona[0m [2m9 months ago[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mHint: 'Personalized' algorithms simply mean tailored to one's biases. As in
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mGoogle will show liberals only liberal articles, and conservatives conservative

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mto maximise engagement_.
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mRecommendation algorithms try to provide content that you'll enjoy, like new

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mEngagement algorithms will try to find content that keeps you engaged, even if
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mthat means enraging you. They don't just exploit biases, rather they exploit

  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mA good phrase I ran into is "strategic empathy". Like Sun Tzu teaches:
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mhundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mgained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0myourself, you will succumb in every battle."
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mSadly, humans seem allergic to this kind of thinking. As Orwell writes in
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m"Notes on Nationalism":
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m"The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with the
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mstrongest side. On the contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthat it is the strongest, and is able to stick to his belief even when the
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mfacts are overwhelmingly against him. Nationalism is power hunger tempered by
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mself-deception. Every nationalist is capable of the most flagrant dishonesty,
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mbut he is also ‚Äì since he is conscious of serving something bigger than himself
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m‚Äì unshakeably certain of being in the right."
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mThe smart (if mistaken) reasons to vote Trump were always trade and the
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mDemocratic Party's abandonment of Labor.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mAnd Republicans, on the other hand, who think Biden is a socialist are
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mdelusional.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mIt's possible, though, that people aren't as dumb as they seem. For an
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mindividual, pretending not to empathize with the opposition is probably safer
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0min a tribalized society. So perhaps that's what we're really witnessing.

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mAs a European it was incomprehensible to me why anyone would vote for trump as
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mI had only received the straw man version of Trump through my local media. But
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mwhen traveling the U.S. early 2016 I had the good fortune of spending a few
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mhours on a bus with two trump voters and having them explain their hopes for a
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mtrump presidency, and it no longer seemed irrational. The hope that having no
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mloyalties or obligations to the political powers that be he could actually
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mhave policies which benefited regular people seemed reasonable. There is a
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mfair argument to be made his actual economic policies have indeed mostly
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mbenefited Americans, so someone voting just based on the economy would not be

  [0m
  [0mFederal Election records indicate that the leadership of technology companies

  [0maddress this. I am not a fan of government regulation, more of a "let the

  [0mthe technology "owner" can exploit it to harm society in a way that was
  [0mpreviously impossible.
  [0m
  [0mWhile the country has focused on disinformation and hate speech, consider a
  [0mcompany that controls, in real time, the self-driving software in a car. Such a
  [0mtechnology, if weaponized, to could kill hundreds of thousands of people. Or it
  [0mcould be weaponize to kill select people who were in the intersection of riding
  [0min a self-driven car and in disfavor by the company that really controls that
  [0mcar.
  [0m
  [0mEarly on in my career I chose not to work for military contractors who were the
  [0m"big" employers in Los Angeles at the time I graduated from college. They were
  [0mclearly engaged in finding clever, or at least more effective, ways to kill
  [0mpeople and that wasn't where I wanted to spend my time. But what about someone
  [0mworking on self driving? It saves lives by avoiding some of the things end up
  [0mresulting in crashes. But it also provides an opportunity for great evil.
  [0m
  [0mDo we trust the person in charge to not be evil? Companies change and while they
  [0mmight declare their intentions when they are growing, what happens when they are
  [0mon top? Sometimes those quaint notions get cast aside when being a little bit
  [0mevil makes what you're trying to do that much easier or maybe that much more
  [0mprofitable.

  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m(3) The margins in those recounts are much bigger than in 2000 --- tens of

  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mThe biggest factor in Florida is that the ballot marking system that Florida
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mused at that time was extremely prone to failure, especially with regards to
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mmachine reading of ballots (which itself could cause an apparent mark on the
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mballot!). This means that trying to divine whether or not a ballot recorded an
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mintent to vote for a candidate can be subjective and depends on the exact
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mstandard you want to use, which Florida didn't specify (and the Florida Supreme

  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mSince 2000, most states have switched to optical scan ballots as their paper

  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mmillion votes. I don't think there's been a single race using optical scan

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mAnother thing that complicated this was that the way you punched the ballot

    [0m[32m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mThe reason why it was never realistic to believe he wouldn't step aside is
    [0m[32m‚ñé[0msimply that he does not have the support to pull that off; it's essentially a

    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mAnd that's why it's so insidious to undermine the election, because that will

    [0m[32m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mHad the election been closer, it's conceivable he might really have
    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mengineered some legal shenanigans to try and steal the election. And if he
    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mhad been backed in that (which isn't entirely impossible, because some of the
    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mtoss-up states have republican-appointed courts, republican legislatures,
    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mand republican governors, and of course the heavily tilted supreme court

    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mother strong-man democracies, the outcome of the election would have been

    [0m[32m‚ñé[0melections, even though formally they lost them? That's the kind of thing that
    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mbreaks a democracy; because both backing down and confrontation are terrible

    [0m[32m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mTo their credit - because that's how it's supposed to work in a democracy -
    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mthose toss-up states did not seriously try to steal votes (although the

    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mEarlier I was looking at a live online polling update with maps of both state
    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mand popular vote figures. The popular vote map was detailed enough for me to

    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mNebraska with sparce populations and high overall Republican vote one would
    [0m[32m‚ñé[0moccasionally (but not infrequently) come across small settlements of 500/1000
    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mor so only 20/50 miles apart where the vote in one was say D-70%, R-28%,

    [0m[32m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mThis seems to backup your tribal identity point very well. Given that these
    [0m[32m‚ñé[0msettlements likely have only trees or farmland between them the figures are
    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mactually quite startling. I took into account that some may have been Native

    [0m[32m‚ñé[0mstates with low populations such as Vermont and New Hampshire and found
    [0m[32m‚ñé[0msimilar instances (of course, with these latter instances the overall state

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mI agree that there is an issue with housing being so inaccessible to labor. In

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mincreasingly need two six figure plus salaries to make it work. IMO, part of
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mthe problem is that everyone views housing as an investment. People trade real
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mestate like trading cards. We forget that homes have a more fundamental
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mpurpose (to house people).

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mestate. There are even diversified REIT ETFs. It's like being a landlord, you
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mget paid dividends, but you don't have to lift a finger. If someone has some

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mThe unfortunate difference though is that mortgage rates are subsidized by the
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mgovernment, interest rates are kept artificially low. If you get a mortgage to
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mbuy a property, it's effectively leveraged investing. You pay a small
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mdownpayment (as low as 10% nowadays) and you're basically investing with

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mThe news organizations were sitting on the document and afterward they said

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mloudly about all the possible ways that Biden and his son [3mmight[0m be corrupt.
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mI can kind of see his point, since everybody in Washington seems to regard

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mof interest in the political discourse.
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mVery little of "the press" or "journalism" that reaches the true majority of
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mpeople can be considered much more than entertainment television. Not only
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mthat, they have very clear goals, partisan alignments, and deals to own up to.
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mMy point being, this picture of "the press" is not new nor is it simple to
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0munravel, especially because a lot of the coverage we see, and how it's done,
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mdepends on a multitude of factors.
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mLet's take, for example, your point about the Hunter Biden story and let's
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mallow ourselves to conjecture for a moment.
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mIn a "press" state such as the one I described above, a big part of the "news
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mmedia" is running amok with the story regardless of having little to no
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mevidence to back it up. On the other hand, the world is still spinning and
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mnews that are noteworthy are still coming out. One might even say people
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mshould know about these things.
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mWhat's one to do in face of such situation? Do we expect that the "news media"
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mdevote all focus to arguing the conspiracy theory, which will most likely
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mboost the conversation around it, or should we expect the "news media" to
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mfocus on things that can actually be proven, assessed, researched?
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mOf course, this is one narrow example that only scratches the surface of
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0msomething that, like I said, is very complex. But I do believe that,
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mconsidering the current environment, it's more harmful to debate the
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mconspiracy stories than to ignore them. Consider any other conspiracy theory
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mthat you ever heard of. Would it be beneficial for anyone to have constant
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mdebate on television about whether or not the Earth is round, or if men have

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mThe news as a whole shrugging off a story about Hunter Biden makes perfect

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mquickly dismissed the fact that the actual democratic institutions were

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mthat ballots didn't represent vote intention), but rather the claim quite

  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mOn the topic of psyops, one of the most used techniques is called the "limited

  [0m[31m‚ñé[0manalysis will show that those who talk about it (I would posit are often not
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0morganic), also talk about much more legitimate conspiracy theories. The intent

  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m[3massociation[0m. Qanon is such an operation. It took what could have been a

  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mhuge amounts of business and politicians [3mon both sides of the isle[0m, and turned
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mit into a partisan, quasi-religious outlet that goes nowhere, but always
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mpromises something is about to happen (keeping the partipants hopeful and

  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mmodicum of truth, or rather, a handful of reasons people should be much more
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mskeptical of the intentions of Bill Gates on the topic. For example, Bill Gates
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mhad quite an extensive relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, something a cursory
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0msearch on the topic from mainstream sources will give nothing more than a
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mpassing mention. He had a relatively sordid relationship with the pharma
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mindustry in India, one worth digging into. On the "microchip" thing, another
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mgreat example. Gate's related foundations and companies have openly talked
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mabout the quantum dot system, which is just readable markers to identify who
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mhas had a particular vaccine, and have actively partnered with the pentagon and
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mdarpa, and the ID2020 program is being tested on newborns in Bangladesh and
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mhomelss people in Austin, TX already. Those kinds of assocation alone are
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0menough to at least empathize and understand where those who then take that and
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mbuy into the microchips story are coming from. So while it's untrue that the
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mGate's linked programs intend to put microchips in, the talk of digital
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mcertificates linked to biometrics such as quantum dot scare people, and then
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mcombine that with the fact that DARPA and the pentagon [3mhave been investigating[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m[3msuch microchips[0m, along with a history of medically experimenting on humans
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mwithout consent, it's easy to see the jump to conclusions being made.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mGiven the huge amount of propaganda being heaped on the American public from
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mall sides then, I think you should reconsider judging so harshly those who have

  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mdisproportionate judging of people in the current day to be very unprincipled
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0malso. We can invade countries illegally, murder hundreds of thousands of people

  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mco-equal sovereignty of a bunch of states that wanted to be closer to nations

  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mabsolute governing authority.

  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mThe framers of the Constitution didn't get everything right, but it's very
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0museful to keep that perspective in mind when trying to understand the form of
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthe US government.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mIf you take the perspective of states as sovereign, with federation between
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthem, then the Electoral College starts to make a lot more sense. The goal was
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mto preserve the power of a [3mstate[0m in the federal government, as much as to
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mrepresent the collection of people from all states - both concepts were
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mcritical. The idea is that people from the nation deserve representation [3mand[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthat each state (and the people from that state as a sub-population) deserve
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mrepresentation.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mIf federation of states is a core concept of the subdivision of governing
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mresponsibility, then it makes sense to build a system that ensures each state
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mhas meaningful weight in the governance of that federation.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mNone of this is an argument for or against the Electoral College, nor should it
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mbe interpreted as arguing for the
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mcorrectness/effectiveness/righteousness/morality of the institution. It is
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0msimply an attempt to share perspective to help understand why the system is the
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mway it is.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mAs originally defined, the House of Representatives was the only piece of the
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mfederal government intended to directly represent the people of the nation.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mSenators were originally chosen by state legislatures. The Senate was intended
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mto represent the states, not the people directly.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mThe Electoral College was an intermediary to represent both the states and the
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mpeople - as a compromise, it has many failings that seem obvious today. There
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mis no federal mandate as to how a state's electors choose to cast their votes.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mEach state is responsible for regulating its own voting - this includes how
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mpeople vote and how electors are chosen and how those electors vote. It is mere
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mhappenstance that the majority of states have a winner-takes-all allotment
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mstrategy for their electors. Maine and Nebraska notably assign their electors
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mproportionally.
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mIt is also interesting to note that the tie-breaking mechanism for an Electoral
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mCollege tie devolves to the House, not with one vote per representative, but
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mwith one vote per state. This is another example of the concept that [3mstates[0m are

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mOn top of that, concentrating the defense spending of the alliance within the

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mincrease on a year-by-year basis. 3. Germany spends quite a lot on foreign

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mThere is a silent understanding (silent, because it isn't raised) that the US
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mtakes a larger part of NATO spending because it's politically feasible to do
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mso there, and because protecting Europe is to protect US interests as well.
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mIn some places, spending 2% GDP on defense (meaning cutting back on something
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0melse) would be political suicide. So that government is kicked out and it
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mremains 1.2% or something. What happens then? Nato kicks out the member state?
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mThat hardly helps any more than a member paying 1.2% and promising to help

  [0mAs a Canadian, what stands out for me about the last two elections is that many
  [0mAmericans seem to desperately want a variety of political reforms, but neither
  [0mparty seems interested in providing them. Trump and Sanders both sold themselves
  [0mas reform candidates in 2016, but only Trump wound up on the ticket.
  [0m
  [0mSanders might be the real deal, but he's not going to represent a major party
  [0muntil donation and campaign spending limits (like we have in Canada) reduce
  [0mcorporate influence on U.S. politics. Sanders scares away the "big money" that
  [0mU.S. elections depend so heavily on.
  [0m
  [0mTrump has not proven to be a reform candidate in any sense of the word. As a
  [0mpolitical outsider with control over both the house and senate for his first two
  [0myears in office, he had the power to deliver meaningful reforms, but didn't.
  [0mAmericans desiring reform [3mshould[0m have felt deeply betrayed by Trump's first
  [0mterm.
  [0m
  [0mThe democrats had a smoother primary in 2020, but decided on an utterly bland
  [0mcandidate. Biden is a return to the status-quo. I predicted that, after the last
  [0mfour years, a return to the status quo would appeal to many, but this election
  [0mproves otherwise. This [3mshould[0m have been an [3measy[0m slam dunk for the Democrats to
  [0mwin, but it's turned out to be a squeaker!
  [0m
  [0mIf the democrats ride the status quo for the next four years and both parties
  [0mwere to run the same candidates again, I suspect Biden would lose. The Democrats
  [0mneed to pay attention to what Americans want.
  [0m
  [0mI would suggest that Biden's administration should, despite running on a
  [0mthoroughly status-quo platform, [3membrace[0m reform. Too many Americans mistrust
  [0mtheir own political system, to the point that they're willing to picket polling
  [0mstations because they think fraud is being committed. That must be fixed.
  [0mFinding ways to reduce the influence of money on politics (e.g. campaign
  [0mspending limits) would be a good start. It will also be an easy sell to devolve
  [0mand distribute some of the powers that have accumulated in the white house over
  [0mthe last several decades. If you're not comfortable with some of the powers
  [0mTrump wielded during his time in office, then perhaps those powers shouldn't
  [0mrest with the POTUS.
  [0m
  [0mBottom line, if the democrats try to pretend Trump [3mnever[0m happened and [3mcouldn't[0m
  [0mhappen again, they're in for unpleasant surprises.

  [0mHere is a simplifying view: In the US there are some people, less than 1% of the
  [0mvoting population, who have a lot of power and control of a lot of money and are
  [0mlooking to the political system to make more money.
  [0m
  [0mThis less than 1% do disagree among themselves, and that disagreement is the
  [0mfundamental source of essentially all the political fighting.
  [0m
  [0mFor the other 99+%, there isn't much to fight about.
  [0m
  [0mWhat the other 99+% want can be summarized in one word ‚Äî [3mmore[0m. For more detail,
  [0mthey want the two biggies, peace and prosperity. For more, they want "life,
  [0mliberty, and the pursuit of happiness", financial and emotional security, love,
  [0mhome and family, good health, happy, successful children. There's not a lot to
  [0mfight about there.
  [0m
  [0mSo, again, the fighting is from the less than 1% who want to use their money and
  [0mpower to get more money.
  [0m
  [0mOf course, way more than 1% of the voting population are highly concerned about
  [0mpolitics, are fighting, but, sorry, guys, they are foot soldiers, pawns, for the
  [0mless than 1%.
  [0m
  [0mAs an example, let's take one of the issues, say, health care. Glancing at
  [0mhistory, US health care has come a long way since the lone country doctor with a
  [0mone horse carriage. In terms of current US medicine, he was not very good.
  [0mPoint: Health care has changed a lot and is still changing, rapidly. So, what
  [0msolution we come up with should accommodate such change.
  [0m
  [0mHealth care can be really expensive, and we need a solution for that. We need in
  [0msome sense to [3mlevel out[0m the costs, make them predictable. Ways have been private
  [0mmedical insurance, health care membership organizations, and government
  [0mprovided health care.
  [0m
  [0mSo, here are the main concerns: Private health insurance is too expensive for a
  [0mmajor fraction of the population, so those people look to other options. Then
  [0mfor the other options, concerns are quality of care (it might be too cheap and
  [0mnot very good ‚Äî loved ones could die), waiting times, and big tax increases.
  [0mPoint: These are all issues, but some examples can show that we should be able
  [0mto do quite well on all the issues of quality, waiting times, costs, etc., well
  [0menough that we should not have much to fight about.
  [0m
  [0mAnd there has been the issue of private insurance and "pre-existing" conditions.
  [0mWe can all agree that it would be nice for private insurance companies to ignore
  [0msuch data, conditions. And the richer US states did have laws forcing the
  [0minsurance companies to so ignore. But maybe now the US is wealthy enough to so
  [0mignore for everyone. Hopefully. So, we can all agree or nearly so. Not much to
  [0mfight about.
  [0m
  [0mSo, what is the cause of the the fighting? With some approaches and situations,
  [0mfor less than 1% of the voting population, there is or can be a lot of money
  [0minvolved, or a lot of power and then a lot of money.
  [0m
  [0mMy view is that we can go down the list of main political topics and conclude
  [0mthe same ‚Äî for 99+% of the voters, there's not much to fight about except some
  [0mpeople, less than 1%, want to fight to make money, big money.
  [0m
  [0mBut for various policies, operations, programs, etc., it really is possible just
  [0mto make a mess, to create waste. At least the 99+% can be against the waste!
  [0m
  [0mE.g., for the [36m$trilions[0m W and Obama spent on Gulf War II, was that from (a)
  [0mpeople who were in line to make money from the effort or (b) just waste? I'd
  [0msay, some of (a) but mostly (b). Point: Not all the issues are about the less
  [0mthan 1% seeking money and, instead, there can also be ordinary waste.
  [0m
  [0mBottom line: The 99% should throttle the less than 1%, settle differences, and
  [0mget on with life.

  [0mThe division and basically legal corruption are my concerns.
  [0m
  [0mOn a basic level, we are all people and all run the same basic way, and have the
  [0msame basic needs.
  [0m
  [0mOne layer up, we are Americans. Those of us who travel, or who communicate
  [0moutside the domestic US, see many other nations and often a higher degree of
  [0msolidarity as citizens.
  [0m
  [0mLooks like a priority problem to me.
  [0m
  [0mWe all need to earn enough to make it, or we all end up paying the costs
  [0massociated with chronic homelessness, for example.
  [0m
  [0mWe all need to see the doctor too.
  [0m
  [0mEating good food, and the other human basics are not hard to understand.
  [0m
  [0mOften, I see "those other people" type arguments of various kinds too.
  [0m
  [0mLazy people. Different colored people. Weird people. Other people; namely, not
  [0mpeople like us, or not in our tribe, group, and‚Ä¶
  [0m
  [0mOrdinary people do not have very effective representation. Money talks. And it
  [0mshould, but that brings me back to priorities again.
  [0m
  [0mNo judgement, no blame here. Just observations.
  [0m
  [0mI submit resolving these things to a more harmonious body politic is on us
  [0mpeople. I am not convinced anyone, or entity can just swoop in and improve
  [0mthings.
  [0m
  [0mThat is just where we are today.
  [0m
  [0mOne other observation:
  [0m
  [0mNations older than us have been where we are. Their peoples have had to do the
  [0mwork to get past it, and have had to do that multiple times.
  [0m
  [0mThis tells me we aren't experiencing anything fundementally new, in human terms.
  [0m
  [0mBut it is new to America. New in the sense of the USA being young enough, and
  [0mthe pace of change in the world being rapid enough for the state of things to
  [0mfeel new, or like doom, or, or‚Ä¶
  [0m
  [0mGiven the burden of improving on our current state lies with us as people,
  [0mcitizens, I submit the following:
  [0m
  [0mWe all need to understand one another better. That starts by talking. Really
  [0mtalking and listening. This is best done sans judgement, and with deliberate
  [0mintent to understand better.
  [0m
  [0mWe all are where we are in life, and we all have made choices, and relitigating
  [0mthe past does not appear to hold answers for our future.
  [0m
  [0mThis is about what we do now. It is about our priorities as humans and Americans
  [0mtoo.
  [0m
  [0mTake voting, for example.
  [0m
  [0mPeople had the following options:
  [0m
  [0mVote Major Party
  [0m
  [0mVote other
  [0m
  [0mNo vote.
  [0m
  [0mEveryone made their choice and had reasons, right?
  [0m
  [0mIf we apply the intent to seek understanding of one another and avoid judgement,
  [0mthat means having a talk about why people voted or no voted the way they did.
  [0m
  [0mPeople no voting, often did so because they did not want to consent to, or
  [0mendorse, approve of what they see as ineffective, corrupt governance. Or they
  [0mdid not connect a vote to a positive future for themselves and theirs.
  [0m
  [0mWhy is that? I think many, and include myself until recently, would rush to
  [0mjudge and blame.
  [0m
  [0mA vote for non major party X really is a vote for major party Y. Same for
  [0mstaying home.
  [0m
  [0mAfter talking some, the idea of candidates interviewing for a job comes up and
  [0mpoor or toxic representation means not approving them for the job, and with that
  [0mwe see lazy, or stupid aren't really valid as reasons why.
  [0m
  [0mI will stop there, and urge you to think about how all of that is framed up as a
  [0mduty, or burden and how people may reject all of that in light of what they may
  [0msee as an irrational election.
  [0m
  [0mSame goes for how people have voted or not before too. Those decisions are made,
  [0mcannot be unmade and people had their reasons for making them.
  [0m
  [0mNotably, after some real discussion, the reality hits: we can't tell people to
  [0mapprove of potential leaders, and we can't dictate what is best, nor their point
  [0mof view.
  [0m
  [0mWe can talk to them and understand what they need to cast a vote. We can attract
  [0mthem to join a cause and all that too.
  [0m
  [0mSo why doesn't that happen more?
  [0m
  [0mI submit this is a big part of the priority and mutual understanding and
  [0mconsideration discussion we all need to have.
  [0m
  [0mWithout that talk being a fundamental part of our body politic, we appear to be
  [0mdivided into factions, blocs who understand others, "those other people"
  [0mincreasingly poorly as pressure to avoid the worst continues to rise.
  [0m
  [0mWith that discussion, it becomes much easier to see what we may consider an
  [0mobvious, rational choice, say lesser evil as an example, really is not so
  [0mobvious, or may even be harmful, not a lesser evil, but perhaps just a different
  [0mkind.
  [0m
  [0mNo matter how this all goes, at any given time our future is about the decisions
  [0mwe make together, the actions we take together, and the outcome we live with
  [0mtogether.
  [0m
  [0mThe election is past us now, but please do consider it was about the votes
  [0mpeople were about to cast, not the ones they may have cast in the past.
  [0m
  [0mTalking about all that is much easier and can be far more effective when people
  [0mare not also fending off negative, and frankly until we understand one another
  [0mbetter, uninformed personal judgements too.
  [0m
  [0mWe are divided to a harmful degree despite all of us having the same basic
  [0mhumanity.
  [0m
  [0mI urge you to talk, and I mean really talk with others very indifferent from
  [0myou, who live differently than you do and understand one another better.
  [0m
  [0mI do not know how we get our priorities in order as people otherwise. And
  [0mwithout that, we rub the risk of our future continuing to be an increasingly
  [0mmixed bag for increasing numbers of us.
  [0m
  [0mFinally, consider this idea:
  [0m
  [0mWhen we make the discussion about what we oppose, it is not going to be about
  [0mwhat we need, or want that is good.
  [0m
  [0mThink about trying to lead a team by only telling them what not to do. They will
  [0mget somewhere, and it won't be anything anyone opposed either.
  [0m
  [0mWe all benefit from an explicit, public good. That means the basics are in order
  [0mleaving people with free agency to get after better, or what they want.
  [0m
  [0mUnderstanding one another better will make that explicit, public good more
  [0mclear.
  [0m
  [0mIt will improve our basic solidarity as people, reduce division.
  [0m
  [0mI submit one final idea:
  [0m
  [0mThere will not be a net public good we all benefit from and depend on, unless we
  [0mmake the discussion, body politic, about it.
  [0m
  [0mAnd that is how I am playing it now, and have been for a while now.
  [0m
  [0mI want and need to be voting FOR good, not AGAINST bad, or evil.
  [0m
  [0mYou probably do too, and I encourage you to make more of the discussion about
  [0mthat explicit, public good and demand our leaders do the same things; namely,
  [0munderstand the people they need votes from better, and to apply that
  [0munderstanding to propose policy people can vote FOR, not just default to people
  [0mvoting AGAINST the very worst.

  [0mthat the unified Republican elite, along with > 35% of the electorate, is
  [0mfundamentally lawless and anti-democratic, and will do anything it can to cheat
  [0mits way into power. All three branches are implicated and have been for a while:
  [0mBush v Gore in 2000, the US Attorney firings, Shelby County in 2013, the
  [0mrefusal of the Senate to convict Trump in 2020, the disgusting anti-science

  [0m

  [0muniversal human rights, respecting fair elections, following the plain text of

  [0m
  [0mOne possibility is to amend the constitution to change first-past-the-post
  [0mvoting in all local-to-federal elections, to let never-Trump types speak out
  [0mwithout facing electoral suicide, and to divert right-conservative attention
  [0maway from a single ‚Äúleader‚Äù figure. And obviously the electoral college needs to
  [0mgo.
  [0m
  [0mBut the fact that more than 65 million people voted for Trump at all speaks to a

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mI think the style of lying is definitely part of it, but I do think the

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mfor Biden, as I did for Clinton in 2016). He was pretty heated, because a

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mthat she didn't think anyone should vote for Trump. It was toward the end of a

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mpretty decent guy, so I engaged, and we had a solid chat.
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mI made a point that seemed to resonate with him - Biden represents high-level
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mcorruption, the kind of slick corruption that maintains stability and is
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mrelatively predictable. Trump, though, represents a mob style of corruption -
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mor the kind of corruption you see from dictators in developing nations. If it
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mbenefits him in the short-term, and he can do it, he will. Chess vs Checkers.
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mSome people prefer the latter, and it seems some view it as a more honest type
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mof corruption, but for most people, stability is important.
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mI've noticed a lot of Right-leaning people would also like to see some form of

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mI think you bring up key issues in your closing paragraph, but the
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mimplementation of Globalization is what really hurt the middle class in the
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mUS. Whenever people lose a proper balance, they will suffer, and I think most

   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mwas in their shoes in 2016, and I can relate to some of their concerns. If we
   [0m[33m‚ñé[0mstart from a place of understanding/trying to understand, we can build systems

  [0m[31m‚ñé[0msome degree or another too. 2) The solution to any "interesting" problem -
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mespecially social problems - involves tradeoffs, conflicting objectives, pros
  [0m[31m‚ñé[0mand cons. If the solution really were trivial and simple, we wouldn't argue

  [0m[31m‚ñé[0multimately everyone wants pretty much the same high level objectives, the
