  [0mnow draw on that experience, and I can take a political tweet that everyone on

  [0mdancer, I can flip it in my head so it seems reasonable.

              [0m[32m‚ñé[0mactually functions by garnering support of opposition parties. (We
              [0m[32m‚ñé[0malso effectively don't have multiple veto points though, so

              [0m[32m‚ñé[0misn't perfect. For instance by virtue of being both multi-party and

      [0m[31m‚ñé[0ma modicum of truth, or rather, a handful of reasons people should be much
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mmore skeptical of the intentions of Bill Gates on the topic. For example,
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mBill Gates had quite an extensive relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0msomething a cursory search on the topic from mainstream sources will give
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mnothing more than a passing mention. He had a relatively sordid
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mrelationship with the pharma industry in India, one worth digging into. On
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthe "microchip" thing, another great example. Gate's related foundations
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mand companies have openly talked about the quantum dot system, which is
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mjust readable markers to identify who has had a particular vaccine, and
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mhave actively partnered with the pentagon and darpa, and the ID2020 program

      [0m[31m‚ñé[0malready. Those kinds of assocation alone are enough to at least empathize
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mand understand where those who then take that and buy into the microchips
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mstory are coming from. So while it's untrue that the Gate's linked programs
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mintend to put microchips in, the talk of digital certificates linked to
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mbiometrics such as quantum dot scare people, and then combine that with the

      [0m[31m‚ñé[0malong with a history of medically experimenting on humans without consent,

      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mThe Constitution of the United States is a document written to preserve
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mco-equal sovereignty of a bunch of states that wanted to be closer to
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mnations than provinces, while avoiding the then-very-apparent risk of
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mcentralized absolute governing authority.
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mThe framers of the Constitution didn't get everything right, but it's very
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0museful to keep that perspective in mind when trying to understand the form
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mof the US government.
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mIf you take the perspective of states as sovereign, with federation between
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthem, then the Electoral College starts to make a lot more sense. The goal
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mwas to preserve the power of a [3mstate[0m in the federal government, as much as
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mto represent the collection of people from all states - both concepts were
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mcritical. The idea is that people from the nation deserve representation
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0m[3mand[0m that each state (and the people from that state as a sub-population)
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mdeserve representation.
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mIf federation of states is a core concept of the subdivision of governing
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mresponsibility, then it makes sense to build a system that ensures each
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mstate has meaningful weight in the governance of that federation.
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mNone of this is an argument for or against the Electoral College, nor
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mshould it be interpreted as arguing for the
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mcorrectness/effectiveness/righteousness/morality of the institution. It is
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0msimply an attempt to share perspective to help understand why the system is
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthe way it is.
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mAs originally defined, the House of Representatives was the only piece of
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthe federal government intended to directly represent the people of the
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mnation. Senators were originally chosen by state legislatures. The Senate
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mwas intended to represent the states, not the people directly.
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mThe Electoral College was an intermediary to represent both the states and
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthe people - as a compromise, it has many failings that seem obvious today.
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mThere is no federal mandate as to how a state's electors choose to cast
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mtheir votes. Each state is responsible for regulating its own voting - this
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mincludes how people vote and how electors are chosen and how those
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0melectors vote. It is mere happenstance that the majority of states have a
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mwinner-takes-all allotment strategy for their electors. Maine and Nebraska
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mnotably assign their electors proportionally.
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mIt is also interesting to note that the tie-breaking mechanism for an
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mElectoral College tie devolves to the House, not with one vote per
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mrepresentative, but with one vote per state. This is another example of the
      [0m[31m‚ñé[0mconcept that [3mstates[0m are a concept deserving of representation.

  [0mAs a Canadian, what stands out for me about the last two elections is that many
  [0mAmericans seem to desperately want a variety of political reforms, but neither
  [0mparty seems interested in providing them. Trump and Sanders both sold themselves
  [0mas reform candidates in 2016, but only Trump wound up on the ticket.
  [0m
  [0mSanders might be the real deal, but he's not going to represent a major party
  [0muntil donation and campaign spending limits (like we have in Canada) reduce
  [0mcorporate influence on U.S. politics. Sanders scares away the "big money" that
  [0mU.S. elections depend so heavily on.
  [0m
  [0mTrump has not proven to be a reform candidate in any sense of the word. As a
  [0mpolitical outsider with control over both the house and senate for his first two
  [0myears in office, he had the power to deliver meaningful reforms, but didn't.
  [0mAmericans desiring reform [3mshould[0m have felt deeply betrayed by Trump's first
  [0mterm.
  [0m
  [0mThe democrats had a smoother primary in 2020, but decided on an utterly bland
  [0mcandidate. Biden is a return to the status-quo. I predicted that, after the last
  [0mfour years, a return to the status quo would appeal to many, but this election
  [0mproves otherwise. This [3mshould[0m have been an [3measy[0m slam dunk for the Democrats to
  [0mwin, but it's turned out to be a squeaker!
  [0m
  [0mIf the democrats ride the status quo for the next four years and both parties
  [0mwere to run the same candidates again, I suspect Biden would lose. The Democrats
  [0mneed to pay attention to what Americans want.
  [0m
  [0mI would suggest that Biden's administration should, despite running on a
  [0mthoroughly status-quo platform, [3membrace[0m reform. Too many Americans mistrust
  [0mtheir own political system, to the point that they're willing to picket polling
  [0mstations because they think fraud is being committed. That must be fixed.
  [0mFinding ways to reduce the influence of money on politics (e.g. campaign
  [0mspending limits) would be a good start. It will also be an easy sell to devolve
  [0mand distribute some of the powers that have accumulated in the white house over
  [0mthe last several decades. If you're not comfortable with some of the powers
  [0mTrump wielded during his time in office, then perhaps those powers shouldn't
  [0mrest with the POTUS.
  [0m
  [0mBottom line, if the democrats try to pretend Trump [3mnever[0m happened and [3mcouldn't[0m

  [0mHere is a simplifying view: In the US there are some people, less than 1% of the
  [0mvoting population, who have a lot of power and control of a lot of money and are
  [0mlooking to the political system to make more money.
  [0m
  [0mThis less than 1% do disagree among themselves, and that disagreement is the
  [0mfundamental source of essentially all the political fighting.
  [0m
  [0mFor the other 99+%, there isn't much to fight about.
  [0m
  [0mWhat the other 99+% want can be summarized in one word ‚Äî [3mmore[0m. For more detail,
  [0mthey want the two biggies, peace and prosperity. For more, they want "life,
  [0mliberty, and the pursuit of happiness", financial and emotional security, love,
  [0mhome and family, good health, happy, successful children. There's not a lot to
  [0mfight about there.
  [0m
  [0mSo, again, the fighting is from the less than 1% who want to use their money and
  [0mpower to get more money.
  [0m
  [0mOf course, way more than 1% of the voting population are highly concerned about
  [0mpolitics, are fighting, but, sorry, guys, they are foot soldiers, pawns, for the
  [0mless than 1%.
  [0m
  [0mAs an example, let's take one of the issues, say, health care. Glancing at
  [0mhistory, US health care has come a long way since the lone country doctor with a
  [0mone horse carriage. In terms of current US medicine, he was not very good.
  [0mPoint: Health care has changed a lot and is still changing, rapidly. So, what
  [0msolution we come up with should accommodate such change.
  [0m
  [0mHealth care can be really expensive, and we need a solution for that. We need in
  [0msome sense to [3mlevel out[0m the costs, make them predictable. Ways have been private
  [0mmedical insurance, health care membership organizations, and government
  [0mprovided health care.
  [0m
  [0mSo, here are the main concerns: Private health insurance is too expensive for a
  [0mmajor fraction of the population, so those people look to other options. Then
  [0mfor the other options, concerns are quality of care (it might be too cheap and
  [0mnot very good ‚Äî loved ones could die), waiting times, and big tax increases.
  [0mPoint: These are all issues, but some examples can show that we should be able
  [0mto do quite well on all the issues of quality, waiting times, costs, etc., well
  [0menough that we should not have much to fight about.
  [0m
  [0mAnd there has been the issue of private insurance and "pre-existing" conditions.
  [0mWe can all agree that it would be nice for private insurance companies to ignore
  [0msuch data, conditions. And the richer US states did have laws forcing the
  [0minsurance companies to so ignore. But maybe now the US is wealthy enough to so
  [0mignore for everyone. Hopefully. So, we can all agree or nearly so. Not much to
  [0mfight about.
  [0m
  [0mSo, what is the cause of the the fighting? With some approaches and situations,
  [0mfor less than 1% of the voting population, there is or can be a lot of money
  [0minvolved, or a lot of power and then a lot of money.
  [0m
  [0mMy view is that we can go down the list of main political topics and conclude
  [0mthe same ‚Äî for 99+% of the voters, there's not much to fight about except some
  [0mpeople, less than 1%, want to fight to make money, big money.
  [0m
  [0mBut for various policies, operations, programs, etc., it really is possible just
  [0mto make a mess, to create waste. At least the 99+% can be against the waste!
  [0m
  [0mE.g., for the [36m$trilions[0m W and Obama spent on Gulf War II, was that from (a)
  [0mpeople who were in line to make money from the effort or (b) just waste? I'd
  [0msay, some of (a) but mostly (b). Point: Not all the issues are about the less
  [0mthan 1% seeking money and, instead, there can also be ordinary waste.
  [0m
  [0mBottom line: The 99% should throttle the less than 1%, settle differences, and

  [0mThe division and basically legal corruption are my concerns.
  [0m
  [0mOn a basic level, we are all people and all run the same basic way, and have the
  [0msame basic needs.
  [0m
  [0mOne layer up, we are Americans. Those of us who travel, or who communicate
  [0moutside the domestic US, see many other nations and often a higher degree of
  [0msolidarity as citizens.
  [0m
  [0mLooks like a priority problem to me.
  [0m
  [0mWe all need to earn enough to make it, or we all end up paying the costs
  [0massociated with chronic homelessness, for example.
  [0m
  [0mWe all need to see the doctor too.
  [0m
  [0mEating good food, and the other human basics are not hard to understand.
  [0m
  [0mOften, I see "those other people" type arguments of various kinds too.
  [0m
  [0mLazy people. Different colored people. Weird people. Other people; namely, not
  [0mpeople like us, or not in our tribe, group, and‚Ä¶
  [0m
  [0mOrdinary people do not have very effective representation. Money talks. And it
  [0mshould, but that brings me back to priorities again.
  [0m
  [0mNo judgement, no blame here. Just observations.
  [0m
  [0mI submit resolving these things to a more harmonious body politic is on us
  [0mpeople. I am not convinced anyone, or entity can just swoop in and improve
  [0mthings.
  [0m
  [0mThat is just where we are today.
  [0m
  [0mOne other observation:
  [0m
  [0mNations older than us have been where we are. Their peoples have had to do the
  [0mwork to get past it, and have had to do that multiple times.
  [0m
  [0mThis tells me we aren't experiencing anything fundementally new, in human terms.
  [0m
  [0mBut it is new to America. New in the sense of the USA being young enough, and
  [0mthe pace of change in the world being rapid enough for the state of things to
  [0mfeel new, or like doom, or, or‚Ä¶
  [0m
  [0mGiven the burden of improving on our current state lies with us as people,
  [0mcitizens, I submit the following:
  [0m
  [0mWe all need to understand one another better. That starts by talking. Really
  [0mtalking and listening. This is best done sans judgement, and with deliberate
  [0mintent to understand better.
  [0m
  [0mWe all are where we are in life, and we all have made choices, and relitigating
  [0mthe past does not appear to hold answers for our future.
  [0m
  [0mThis is about what we do now. It is about our priorities as humans and Americans
  [0mtoo.
  [0m
  [0mTake voting, for example.
  [0m
  [0mPeople had the following options:
  [0m
  [0mVote Major Party
  [0m
  [0mVote other
  [0m
  [0mNo vote.
  [0m
  [0mEveryone made their choice and had reasons, right?
  [0m
  [0mIf we apply the intent to seek understanding of one another and avoid judgement,
  [0mthat means having a talk about why people voted or no voted the way they did.
  [0m
  [0mPeople no voting, often did so because they did not want to consent to, or
  [0mendorse, approve of what they see as ineffective, corrupt governance. Or they
  [0mdid not connect a vote to a positive future for themselves and theirs.
  [0m
  [0mWhy is that? I think many, and include myself until recently, would rush to
  [0mjudge and blame.
  [0m
  [0mA vote for non major party X really is a vote for major party Y. Same for
  [0mstaying home.
  [0m
  [0mAfter talking some, the idea of candidates interviewing for a job comes up and
  [0mpoor or toxic representation means not approving them for the job, and with that
  [0mwe see lazy, or stupid aren't really valid as reasons why.
  [0m
  [0mI will stop there, and urge you to think about how all of that is framed up as a
  [0mduty, or burden and how people may reject all of that in light of what they may
  [0msee as an irrational election.
  [0m
  [0mSame goes for how people have voted or not before too. Those decisions are made,
  [0mcannot be unmade and people had their reasons for making them.
  [0m
  [0mNotably, after some real discussion, the reality hits: we can't tell people to
  [0mapprove of potential leaders, and we can't dictate what is best, nor their point
  [0mof view.
  [0m
  [0mWe can talk to them and understand what they need to cast a vote. We can attract
  [0mthem to join a cause and all that too.
  [0m
  [0mSo why doesn't that happen more?
  [0m
  [0mI submit this is a big part of the priority and mutual understanding and
  [0mconsideration discussion we all need to have.
  [0m
  [0mWithout that talk being a fundamental part of our body politic, we appear to be
  [0mdivided into factions, blocs who understand others, "those other people"
  [0mincreasingly poorly as pressure to avoid the worst continues to rise.
  [0m
  [0mWith that discussion, it becomes much easier to see what we may consider an
  [0mobvious, rational choice, say lesser evil as an example, really is not so
  [0mobvious, or may even be harmful, not a lesser evil, but perhaps just a different
  [0mkind.
  [0m
  [0mNo matter how this all goes, at any given time our future is about the decisions
  [0mwe make together, the actions we take together, and the outcome we live with
  [0mtogether.
  [0m
  [0mThe election is past us now, but please do consider it was about the votes
  [0mpeople were about to cast, not the ones they may have cast in the past.
  [0m
  [0mTalking about all that is much easier and can be far more effective when people
  [0mare not also fending off negative, and frankly until we understand one another
  [0mbetter, uninformed personal judgements too.
  [0m
  [0mWe are divided to a harmful degree despite all of us having the same basic
  [0mhumanity.
  [0m
  [0mI urge you to talk, and I mean really talk with others very indifferent from
  [0myou, who live differently than you do and understand one another better.
  [0m
  [0mI do not know how we get our priorities in order as people otherwise. And
  [0mwithout that, we rub the risk of our future continuing to be an increasingly
  [0mmixed bag for increasing numbers of us.
  [0m
  [0mFinally, consider this idea:
  [0m
  [0mWhen we make the discussion about what we oppose, it is not going to be about
  [0mwhat we need, or want that is good.
  [0m
  [0mThink about trying to lead a team by only telling them what not to do. They will
  [0mget somewhere, and it won't be anything anyone opposed either.
  [0m
  [0mWe all benefit from an explicit, public good. That means the basics are in order
  [0mleaving people with free agency to get after better, or what they want.
  [0m
  [0mUnderstanding one another better will make that explicit, public good more
  [0mclear.
  [0m
  [0mIt will improve our basic solidarity as people, reduce division.
  [0m
  [0mI submit one final idea:
  [0m
  [0mThere will not be a net public good we all benefit from and depend on, unless we
  [0mmake the discussion, body politic, about it.
  [0m
  [0mAnd that is how I am playing it now, and have been for a while now.
  [0m
  [0mI want and need to be voting FOR good, not AGAINST bad, or evil.
  [0m
  [0mYou probably do too, and I encourage you to make more of the discussion about
  [0mthat explicit, public good and demand our leaders do the same things; namely,
  [0munderstand the people they need votes from better, and to apply that
  [0munderstanding to propose policy people can vote FOR, not just default to people
  [0mvoting AGAINST the very worst.

  [0mthat the unified Republican elite, along with > 35% of the electorate, is
  [0mfundamentally lawless and anti-democratic, and will do anything it can to cheat
  [0mits way into power. All three branches are implicated and have been for a while:

          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mdetails matter. I was talking with a Trump supporter (I held my nose
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mand voted for Biden, as I did for Clinton in 2016). He was pretty
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mheated, because a lady he flirts with at work let him know that she was
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0ma hardcore Democrat and that she didn't think anyone should vote for
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mTrump. It was toward the end of a long day, so I wasn't sure if I was
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mup for the conversation, but he's a pretty decent guy, so I engaged,
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mand we had a solid chat.
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mI made a point that seemed to resonate with him - Biden represents
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mhigh-level corruption, the kind of slick corruption that maintains
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mstability and is relatively predictable. Trump, though, represents a
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mmob style of corruption - or the kind of corruption you see from
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mdictators in developing nations. If it benefits him in the short-term,
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mand he can do it, he will. Chess vs Checkers. Some people prefer the
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mlatter, and it seems some view it as a more honest type of corruption,
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mbut for most people, stability is important.
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mI've noticed a lot of Right-leaning people would also like to see some
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mform of ranked voting, so I think it's the political parties (both of
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mthem) rather than the people holding things back.
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mI think you bring up key issues in your closing paragraph, but the

          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mthe US. Whenever people lose a proper balance, they will suffer, and I
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mthink most everyone can agree that the US did a particularly poor job

          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mtheir concerns. If we start from a place of understanding/trying to
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0munderstand, we can build systems that work for everyone. If we allow
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mthe two-party system to perpetuate artificial divides, progress will be
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mmuch slower, and we'll take more false steps. The loudest are
          [0m[33m‚ñé[0mtypically the worst of us. We can't fall into the trap of using them as

  [0mThe thing that will sit deep within me for at least the next few years is that,
  [0mno matter how you slice it, a vote for Trump is complicit acceptance of his
  [0mdivisive and harmful behavior. Of course you don't need to be a racist to vote
  [0mfor Trump, but you do need to fear the other options so much that you agree that
  [0mhis behavior and the way that he represents our country to the rest of the
  [0mworld is tolerable compared to what might come after him.
  [0m
  [0mI was on the phone with my mom earlier and one of her friends called her up.
  [0mShe's a republican, but they avoid politics. She asked her, genuinely afraid, if
  [0mshe thought that Harris would steal the presidency and convert the country to
  [0msocialism. She's not an idiot. She's a physician, but was still so caught up in
  [0mfear mongering that she genuinely believed that the government would steal her
  [0mincome and that there would be riots in the streets as we turn into a third
  [0mworld nation. I'm going to think about her differently after hearing that.
  [0m
  [0mThis is probably the first time in my life where I am going to look at people
  [0mdifferently based on who they voted for and I hate that. However, I can't get it
  [0mout of my head that they voted for a president that has so disgraced the
  [0mhighest office in our country and that they did it because of a fear of the
  [0mfuture burning so far inside them that they felt another four years of Trump was
  [0mpreferable to even as bland of a change as a Biden presidency will be.

  [0mSince the oil embargo of 73-74[[37m0[0m], which was caused by the 'Arab-Israeli War',
  [0msecuring the oil supply from the Middle East has been a top priority of the US
  [0mgovernment. The embargo highlighted how vulnerable the US was to the Middle
  [0mEast. Since then, 'Peace in the Middle East' has been a plum goal of successive
  [0mUS administrations. President Carter was able to get a peace agreement between
  [0mIsrael and Egypt[[31m1[0m] which contributed to his ultimately winning a Nobel
  [0mprize[[33m2[0m].
  [0m
  [0mSucceeding administrations failed to gain additional peace and instead leaned on
  [0mregime change in an attempt to oust unstable governments and seat US-friendly,
  [0mstable regimes. This approach failed in principle: Regime change itself did not
  [0mlead to stability. But instead, led to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and
  [0multimately, it was the protracted presence of US troops in those nations that
  [0mprovided stability. That stability was paid for with the lives of US soldiers
  [0mput in harms way of militants from both within those nations and from outside of
  [0mthem.
  [0m
  [0mUnder Obama, two threats emerged: ISIS and an emboldened Iran. ISIS went from a
  [0m'JV Team', to controlling an area the size of Pennsylvania, spanning Iraq and
  [0mSyria[[32m3[0m]. Iran was granted an agreement to suspend weapons-grade nuclear
  [0mresearch until 2031 [[34m4[0m]. Iran may or may not be complying with the agreement,
  [0mbut it was known that they were causing instability throughout the Middle East,
  [0mfunding ISIS, Hezbolah, and planning and funding ambush attacks on US troops
  [0mthroughout the region[[36m5[0m].
  [0m
  [0mThis was the situation in January 2017.
  [0m
  [0mReviewing what the current administration has done since taking office, the
  [0mcoordinated and deliberate steps, and the results, have been astonishing, given
  [0mthe intractable and largely unsuccessful efforts to stabilize the region over
  [0mthe last 50 years:
  [0m
  [0ma. Established 'energy independence' by modifying US regulations on production
  [0mof oil, natural gas and coal. The US became a net exporter of energy, reducing
  [0mthe leverage that the Middle East states have over the US[[35m6[0m].
  [0m
  [0mb. Moved the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and recognize the Golan Heights
  [0mas Sovereign Israel territory. This worked to gain trust from Israel, improving
  [0mtheir willingness to participate in peace agreements. [[91m8[0m]
  [0m
  [0mc. Coordinated with Russia to eliminate ISIS. It was completely eradicated,
  [0mincluding US Special Forces killing the leader and founder, Al-Baghdadi[[92m10[0m].
  [0m
  [0md. Withdrew from the Iran Nuclear accord, and renewed sanctions against Iran.
  [0mThe funds provided by the accord likely were used in part to fund their terror
  [0mactivities.
  [0m
  [0me. Killed General Soleimani, who was know to be the mastermind and source of
  [0mfunding for terrorism throughout the Middle East, directed not just at US, but
  [0mother Arab States as well. [[97m7[0m] d. and e. illustrated to the Arab States that the
  [0mUS was willing to take decisive action to quell the regional threat that Iran
  [0mposed.
  [0m
  [0mf. Withdrew troops from Syria, extricating the US from that war zone, after ISIS
  [0mwas defeated.
  [0m
  [0mg. Begin withdrawing troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. Most Arab countries want
  [0mthe US out so they can self-govern again.
  [0m
  [0mh. With the above puzzle pieces in place, the administration rapidly concluded
  [0mpeace agreements between Israel and three Arab states: United Arab Emirates,
  [0mBahrain [[93m9[0m] and later, Sudan. Other countries are said to be joining soon.
  [0m
  [0mi. Earned 2 Nobel peace prize nominations for the peace agreements (for 2021,
  [0mwinners will be announced next September).
  [0m
  [0mReviewing this timeline, and the magnitude of this achievement, it's hard to

  [0mThis seems like the logical end of cancel culture and deplatforming, which is to

  [0mTo me this reeks of authoritarian Leftism, like the violence seen in past

  [0mTo assert otherwise, over a weekend when none of the recounts or court cases are
