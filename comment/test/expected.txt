He's kind of totally wrong about the phones and thus the speed being THE killer
feature. First of all, Symbian phones, which [3mwere[0m the market leader smartphones
when the iphone was released were pretty fast. So were feature phones (i.e. dumb
phones).

What iphone was a LOT better at than everyone else was UX. Of which speed is one
component, of course. It's funny how much people never get it although it
happened in front of us, it happened to us. At the time I was working at Nokia
Research and I remember my girlfriend telling me how his boss got this wonderful
phone that you can take photos with and you can view them, etc. The funny thing
is that I had such a phone since 2001. I have been working with smartphones for
6 years then, she knew it, she listened to me when I told her or others what I
was doing (and then listen to others responding "yeah, but phones are for making
phone calls"). She saw me browsing the net on my phones (a 9210 communicator
and then a 9500), send emails from the beach, etc.

Still it somehow didn't register. Because it looked like something that she'd
never use. And then the iphone that did a lot [3mless[0m made her and basically
everyone understand what a smartphone is. (Even though by then symbian
smartphones were pretty common, most people didn't use them as smartphones.)

So no, it's not simply the speed. It's the UX. And even if we talk about speed,
it's still not the speed, but it's the perception of the speed, which a lot has
been written about: delay (lagging) matters a lot even if speed on average is
OK.

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mThose key ingredients included a big screen, a fast enough processor and large

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mbrought these key ingredients together by designing it that way, but they also
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mdid it by not entering the market until powerful enough hardware was available.

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mI think you're right. Speed is a component of the User Experience. My point in
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mwriting this is that when you abstract to a higher level, the beauty of the UX
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mwas that you can instantly do whatever you want. Your thought -> your touch ->
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0maction.
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mHowever, I think you make a great point that the two are interrelated.
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mMy straw man starting point would be:
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mA poor user experience that is lightning fast can still be a great experience.
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mBut a great user experience that lags or is slow will typically not be
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0msuccessful.
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0m
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mThe iphone succeeded because it coupled a great user experience that was so fast
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthat it felt like interacting with objects in the real world.

    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mIt would help me at least if you could specify/ list what you think were the
    [0m[31m‚ñé[0mthings in UX that made it so much better than Symbian phones.

        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mMaybe. But the author says speed IS the killer feature (for products) so it has
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mto be true at the higher level too. UX is the perception of the user of the
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mproduct and their, well, experience [3musing[0m the product. If it's generic it's
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mbecause it really is that generic, because users won't know why exactly they
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mlike a product.
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mBut in the case of iOS vs Symbian:
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0m- as others said: capacitive touch screen (this is not an OS issue, but iphone
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mwas among the firsts to use it, definitely earlier than Nokia). This is huge.
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mLike the thing that everyone was talking about (around me) when the original
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0miphone came out is how you could [3mswipe[0m to see the pictures. And it wasn't just
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mfor paging, it defined how you could interact with the phone (think pinch
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mzooming, and rotation - not sure when these were added).
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0m- the touch screen UI itself. Nokia played around with the touch UI before, but
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mnever really liked it. It was expressed several times internally, that touch is
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mjust a no go. But no wonder: the resistive touch screen is pretty bad, but also
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mSymbian itself was built on the assumption that all you have is keys while iOS
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mwas built with touch UI in mind from the very beginning. (Now, of course touch
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mwas added to Symbian, but that's just not the same. Or they didn't put in the
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0meffort. Nokia even had an experimental touch phone released to the market in
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0m2003, the 7700[[31m1[0m], but it was mostly ridiculous.)
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0m- the UI just was a lot more polished, looked better, classier, the graphics was
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mbetter. They had OpenGL and probably a graphics accelerator - nothing like that
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0min Symbian, of course. (It even took the android guys by surprise, I remember
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mreading/hearing in an interview that when they saw a demo or the release,
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mthey've realized that they had to redo the UI from scratch. Because before that
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mthey had this Blackberry-ish/Symbianish idea, they thought they were competing
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mwith that.)
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0m- I'm pretty sure it had a better browser.
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0m
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mAnd this pretty much defines the experience, the feel a user gets from the
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mphone. It couldn't send or receive MMS-es (some people may have used it then,
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mbut most I guess just wanted to have the feature), it couldn't receive 'push'
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0memail. I.e. you had to manually refresh your inbox, emails didn't just arrive.
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mIt didn't even have apps. Symbian had all these. It has had these for years
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mthen. It even had an app store like thing (at least you had to send in your app
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mfor verification which would then be signed by Nokia or it couldn't be installed
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0m- that was a new thing around 2004-2006, something I think nobody really did
        [0m[33m‚ñé[0mbefore).

                [0m[36m‚ñé[0mBut you are right that the capacitive display itself makes the interaction
                [0m[36m‚ñé[0mfaster because it's enough to touch while the resistive has to be pressed. So
                [0m[36m‚ñé[0mit's probably slower and feels like you have to put in more effort.

I vividly remember using a kiosk to order a sandwich at a gas station 3 years
ago‚Ä¶ Not because the sandwich was great, not because it had a great logo, or a
great name‚Ä¶

The INSTANT I hit the button to complete the order, the built in printer almost
spat the ticket at me. I ordered a second sandwich just so I could get a video
of that happening again.

Edit: Just found and uploaded the video :)

Edit2: looks like it was a soda, not a second sandwich.

This might be because I am a former semi-pro Quake3 player but these days I
grind my teeth with 95% of all software. Everything feels like it has at least
200ms delay injected, on every transition.

I'd honestly pay extra for an iPhone where I can disable ALL motion, too. But
that's the least of the problems.

I don't want to become the grumpy old grandpa yelling "back in my day!‚Ä¶" but we
have waaaaaaaaaaay too much young JS devs who know nothing else.

We need to get back to native UIs. Is it awfully hard? Yes it is. Do the users
care? No, they don't. Many people want fast UIs.

But to be fair to all sides ‚Äî there are also a lot of people who don't notice
certain slowdowns that I scoff at. So there is a middle ground that won't cost
billions to achieve and IMO that should be chased after.

I can certainly attest to this.

Every second support email in the early days of https://www.darwinmail.app was
from users who were wondering why the website wasn't faster to load and operate.

I knew that this was going to slowly kill the product if I didn't focus on
optimising the speed immediately. I also heard somewhere that even a 0.01
increase in load times for Amazon's website would cost them somewhere in the
region of 100's of millions.

1. I gathered feedback from all users that said the website was slow (in any way
and in any page/component/workflow).

2. I created a Trello board https://trello.com/c/PPuhLtW0/95-upgrade-performance
for all the feedback.

3. Since that week of initial performance enhancement research and groundwork, I
have essentially been completing todo's on that Trello card and adding more
tasks as time goes on. I think the more speed improvements I make, the more I
learn about what other parts of the application can be sped up. It's like
economics, the more you learn, the more you realise you have so much more to
learn :D

A few years later and I have not received an email suggesting to increase the
speed of the app in several months, although I continue to make speed
improvements on a regular basis.

Netflix have been my source of inspiration here. They are leagues ahead of every
other streaming service and their custom architecture placed at the ISP level is
absolutely incredible and paramount to how the deliver content with such
amazing speeds.

The thing is, the iPhone isn't that fast, but it is able to react quickly to
your input by showing you a nice, smooth but slow animation while work is being
done in the background. As a result it feels faster.

That's something no other smartphone could do. I don't know how things are today
but I looks like Android more or less "solved" the problem by throwing powerful
hardware at it.

The killer feature is not really speed, but low input latency. And this is
achieved by taking performance in consideration during development. And contrary
to the old "premature optimization is the root of all evil" saying, you have to
do it early, because while can be relatively easy to increase throughput,
latency is much harder to deal with.

This is also part of the success of Google Chrome. While it didn't load pages
that much faster than its competition it was great at showing you something
quickly. It took ages for Firefox to catch up, and it looks like it did mostly
because Chrome became slower over time. How is Servo going BTW?

This is a big reason why I get frustrated with comments about high refresh rate
monitors being mostly for gaming, or it not being that important for
productivity applications.

There's a reason why it's hard to ever go back, once you've experienced the
fluidity of even just your mouse cursor reacting instantly to your movements.

If you've ever used the iPad Pro, there's clearly something special about the
experience. It just _feels_ better, and for all the same reasons described in
the article.

60hz is far from smooth, and that number is a leftover from days past, not what
is actually optimal or good.

Display technologies unfortunately still have ways to go when it comes to high
resolution, color accurate panels, with high refresh rates, but the general
direction on the market is that high refresh rates are not available in the
"productivity" category of monitors, even if sometimes the manufacturer has
panels that would fit the bill. You unfortunately always need to look in the
gaming category, which usually lack many of the features you'd like in a more
productivity centered display. Such as a fully adjustable stand, high color
accuracy and viewing angles, virtual display splitting, or just overall design
of the enclosure.

I could go on another rant about display enclosure designs‚Ä¶ Why isn't there a
single company out there (with perhaps the exception of Dell) that's creating
nice and minimal display enclosures that aren't covered in cheap plastic and
"aesthetic" ornaments? Apple's Cinema Display from 2004 is to this day one of
the better looking enclosures out there.

I don't think you can blame this on the consumers really. For the higher end
market that I'm talking about in general here, I'd be willing to take a bet on
if you build it they will come. I'd certainly be praising any company willing to
take this on to high heavens.

I want a great, fast, accurate panel with a nice, minimal, aluminum enclosure.
Is that just too much to ask?

I've worked on a project that failed and I always felt speed was a real problem.
I tried but never succeeded in convincing people that speed was the issue.

In our case, our users had a specific flow through the application they would
use, and it worked, but it required clicking many (10+) buttons and waiting for
a web request on each. People on the team were satisfied that the flow worked
and going through it didn't take TOO long‚Ä¶ But what people on our side didn't
get is that our customers had to go through this flow dozens if not hundreds of
times - some users would need to do it this many times regularly. It effectively
made our users hate using the product, or they would refuse to, or they'd use
it but only a little bit and they'd try to minimize the cost.

I tried to get people on our side to experience the pain points, e.g. asking PMs
to follow this flow one hundred times, and things like that, but I never could
get through to anyone that we should redesign and refocus on making it usable.
Maybe a mockup of a faster flow was what was needed to be persuasive there.

May be Speed isn't the right word, Latency would be better.

We can look at Input Lag [[31m1[0m], and Microsoft Research's work [[33m2[0m] on Touch Input.
Apple's ProMotion being part of that as well. For the past 20 years we have make
10 - 100x improvement in bandwidth at the expense of Latency. Now we need to do
more work on it . Especially if we want VR or AR which are extremely latency
sensitive. John Carmack [[32m3[0m] used to talk a lot about it when he was still
working on Oculus. How it was faster sending something hundreds of miles away
than showing it on your computer screen.

[2m ‚ñé[3m[2mWhen you touched a Razr or a Palm phone, there was a delay. It felt sluggish[0m
[2m ‚ñé[2;3mand slow.[0m

I always felt like resistive screens were more responsive than capacitive
screens.

Case in point: My 3DS resistive screen and Palm Centro responded instantly. I
think their downside was the necessary use of the stylus (because of the
additional precision, their UIs required you to pull out the stylus before you
could do anything effective).

What the Apple iPod Touch / iPhone did, was allow you to touch without using a
stylus.

Anyway, I read this post as if its a mirror-image of my reality. The one thing I
remember about Apple's capacitive push was that it felt slower than what I was
used to. Honest.

--------

With that being said: I've played fighting games vs opponents who can 1-frame
link and counter-throws within 7-frames (115 milliseconds). I'm well aware of
the human-brain's capability to process data far faster than most people
realize.

Musicians, Video Game players, Athletes‚Ä¶ I expect most of them to have reaction
speeds well above average: below the 200ms typical human. Even then, "average"
humans have far better reaction speeds and ability to perceive things that
happen in factions-of-a-second (at least, once you make them aware of those
things).

UI-speed is absolutely a great feature. I just disagree that Apple's iPod Touch
or iPhone was a good representation of that.

Whenever I bring up the topic of performance and speed of software, I used to
get "Pre-mature optimization is the root of all evil", but in reality, companies
are spending billions just to squeeze an additional 1-2% improvement in
compilers optimizations,browser engines, kernels and processors.

Speed matters. I CAN perceive the latency of using an SPA vs using a native
application. I notice. the diff. between executing a GNU binary vs running a js
based script.

This is a popular sentiment around here, because we care about the craft and
want to build something that is beautiful/well-made.

However, speed is not ‚Äúthe killer feature‚Äù. Speed does not add any value in
isolation; your app needs to solve a need for the user first. If you don‚Äôt have
PMF don‚Äôt think about speed yet.

The article gestures at objectivity by linking some cases where people measured
revenue gains from speed improvements, but fails to follow through and actually
propose an experiment or ROI calc. If you think your app is slow, run an
experiment and measure the impact on conversion. (You can even take a page from
Google‚Äôs book and _add_ delay with a simple sleep() if you don‚Äôt want to spend
any time on perf work before you get data. Or just do the first bit of
low-hanging fruit and measure the impact.)

Talk to your users and ask them what frustrates them in the app. It might be ‚Äú
takes so long to check out‚Äù, or it might be ‚Äúit just lacks feature X that
competitor Y has‚Äù. I‚Äôd suggest it‚Äôs unwise to spend time on perf work if you are
pre-pmf and the main feedback was the latter. Again, do experiments too because
customers don‚Äôt always tell you what they need. In particular enterprise users
often don‚Äôt care as much about speed, as long as you tick all of the boxes. Many
users are used to line-of-business software that is slow and buggy, so your bar
in B2B is not always high here.

Finally do an ROI calculation. If a perf iteration is going to cost you $20k in
dev resource, and get you 7% improvement on $10k of monthly revenue, that might
not be the right thing to focus on. Ideally you‚Äôre looking at features that will
improve your top of funnel volume more than that.

It‚Äôs all a trade-off. It depends on your company‚Äôs level of maturity,
Product/Market fit, and the value of the marginal feature that you‚Äôd be
deferring to make your app go faster.

If we interpret this to be a political manifesto carrying the message ‚Äúyou
should care more about speed/performance‚Äù, I‚Äôd prefer the meta-level ‚Äúyou should
care more about trade-offs and marginal value‚Äù.

Two points:

1) As programmers we're biased to feel like speed is the most important thing
because it's very fun and satisfying to optimize. In reality, for actual users,
it's one of many different axes of value that have to be weighed against each
other. In some domains it's critical, in some it matters very little, in most
cases it's one important factor among many.

2) There are different types of "speed". Generally anything that's supposed to
mimic something physical - basic UI feedback, real-time games/simulations, etc -
has a much higher speed requirement than some abstract process. Will the
process take long enough that it makes sense to show a loading spinner at all?
Then the user probably won't mind waiting a couple extra seconds. Will it take
<500ms? then the user will approximate it to "instant", and will notice if
there's a bit of "lag".

If the original iPhone had taken twice as long as the Treo to load a web page,
but the touch screen was still more responsive, people still would have
perceived it as being "faster". The extra seconds matter less than shaving off
the extra milliseconds.

As a former BlackBerry 10 user (QNX based with C++/QT native apps) that's
something that annoys me endlessly about Android. How can a simple action like
displaying a small, locally cached playlist take any noticeable time at all?!
There is no inherent reason for building Apps in JS+HTML adding a dozen
additional layers all costing precious time. Even some "native" (Java) apps seem
slow at times. Also switching between apps often causes these to be effectively
closed, adding startup time when reopening them (are they really that
memory-hungry, why?!). I never had these problems with my BB 10 phones even
though these had half the RAM (2G, current Android 4G) and way less cores (2 vs.
8). I wish they hadn't discontinued this awesome platform.

I would argue that the key differentiator of the first iPhone was screen size.
It was the first popular phone where essentially the entire face of the phone
was dedicated to screen, made possible by a software keyboard. By today's
standards it's tiny, but at the time nothing else came close. Trying to do
anything on any other phone was impossibly cramped by comparison. Especially
using the web, since there was no such thing as a mobile or responsive page
then, so you needed a phone with the screen real-estate to use desktop websites.
The iPhone was the first phone to make this less than utterly painful.

All that said, I do agree with the general thesis. Evernote has just come up
with a huge update of all their apps, having ported them all to Electron to
standardize development. The only problem is, they're all brutally slow compared
to the native apps that preceded them, and it truly ruins the experience.

Slowdown has actually been the only reason I ever replaced a phone. Somehow the
manufacturer sent an update and stuff turned to molasses, and that has been my
trigger to get a new phone each time. There's no excuse for this, it's not like
the apps I use are especially demanding. I've written a few apps on the side,
and most of the ones I use should just be your average mashup of buttons,
pictures, and REST calls. Besides, the slowdown comes when the OS is updated, so
it's probably not the apps changing.

I'll never get another Samsung, even though I don't know if they did it
deliberately, or if it was even them that did it.

Speed, is a minimum requirement of most systems, same as correctness.

It seems to me that basically 100% of the UI/UX developers at the big tech
companies are woefully ignorant of the fact that there is a massive amount of
data and papers written about human computer interaction. I'm guessing that is
because few comp-sci programs even touch the topic, rather spending all their
time on more esoteric/mathematical topics.

In summary, a very large number of studies were done in the 1960s-1980's on the
_human_ aspects of user responsiveness (important when timesharing became
common), how people learned computer interfaces, and how effective they were at
operating them. Despite some of these papers being > 40 years old, none of it
has really changed because the studies were about humans, less than computers.
The underlying computing may have changed from a time shared terminal to a phone
in someones hand connected to a server, but in that time the human cognitive
loop hasn't changed.

IMHO, and somewhat backed by the science, any system which isn't responding in
under 100ms is broken unless its performing something extraordinary. If its
actually interactive (like typing on a command prompt) even that is far to slow.
User frustration, and loss of attention are real things, and you can bet when
given the choice users will pick less frustrating systems. The saving grace for
many of these platforms is that the entire industry is trying to be like the
fashion industry and follow the latest trends. So it doesn't matter if BigCoX
makes a huge UI blunder all the others will follow it down the lemming hole.

So tell me why some of the conclusions in a paper like
http://larch-www.lcs.mit.edu/~corbato/sjcc62/ (1962) are wrong. How about:
http://yusufarslan.net/sites/yusufarslan.net/files/upload/co‚Ä¶ (1968)

Nothing to see here.

Speed always has been not only the most important thing, but virtually the only
important thing. Back before most of you were born, there was a review (in PC

the others (visicalc and lotus 123, IIRC) in every category except speed, in

The speed requirement is closely related to the self-importance fallacy. If a

There are different kinds of apps for different use cases. Performance is a
feature, but not always necessary.

For example, Line of Business (LOB) apps are built with ROI in mind. LOB apps
help businesses run more efficiently, and employ the vast majority of

much more interested in functionality, automation, and distribution of apps than

I think this is overly reductive.

Speed (or more likely, perceived speed) is only one part of UX, and how much it
matters depends a lot on what else is going on and the users expectation. Even
focusing merely on responsiveness feels a bit superficial.

Something a bit closer to the core of it is that whenever a user is focused on
waiting for your software, it reduces their experience. That can be articulated
better I'm sure - and still is only one part of the (complex) equation.

It seems like Apple is moving backwards on this at the moment, though. Perhaps
they were more concerned about it when they were trying to get into the market.

is that in the meantime there's been another call. Result: I see the person I

changes and I call the wrong person. This happens often enough that I should
learn, but somehow I don't.

If you have a iPhone without home button, go to settings, wallet & apple pay and
uncheck doouble click side button

Now turn off the screen with the power button.

Notice the annoying delay when turning off the screen is gone? enjoy :-)

Of course you also don't have a way to invoke the wallet manually, but luckily
if you put it near a payment terminal it will auto activate

Probably won't work if you're a heavy apple wallet user but if you use it only

This is spot on. I was originally using PayTM to pay my bills for phones and TV.
And while it was a little bloated and sluggish there was nothing better. But
then Google Pay was released, and it was so much faster then anything else on
the market.

But Google Pay released a new update using the flutter framework. And now even
scrolling takes ages to complete. I complained on Play Store but the reply said
to check my internet speed.

Meanwhile PayTM has also redesigned their app, but unlike Google Pay their
updates actually made the app much faster and intuitive. I still check Google
Pay from time to time to see if they have fixed their app, but the scrolling is
still laggy (it feels like you are in a web page) and the loading page still
flickers.

It was only around OMAP iphones when they first got proper hardware

Palms were noticably faster than WinMo 6, and WinMo 6 was faster than 5 which
was indeed painful to use because of input lag.

Ironically, Android is still somwhat slower than WinMo 6 on input lag despite

Speed is a tricky thing in a complex application. You are ultimately going to be
forced to trade latency for horizontal scalability in non-trivial applications
with lots of shared state which must also be consumed globally.

You can cheat in some weird and fun ways though. For instance, if you say "no
user of this system will ever be more than 50ms away", you get to play some
really interesting games with vertical scaling and consolidation of compute
capability in an all-in way. I.e. server-side technologies ran out of a single
datacenter near the userbase.

If your latency domain fits it, something like Blazor server side can be an
incredible experience for your users. First load is almost immediate because
there's virtually no client code. Everything is incremental from there. If you
are within 50ms of the server, UI feels instant in my experience. The nature of
how applications are developed with this tech means that if your business
services are completing requests within the performance budget, you can be
almost certain the end user will see the same.

Going to the bottom of the rabbit hole, understanding how NUMA impacts
performance can make 5+ orders of magnitude difference in latency and
throughput. Letting a thread warm up on a hot path and keeping it fed with
well-structured data is foundational to ultra-low-latency processing.

You can handle well over a million events per second on a single thread on any
recent PC using techniques such as LMAX disruptor combined with a web hosting
technology like Kestrel. The difference between a class and a struct can be 10x
if you get to that level of optimization. I measure user interactions in
microseconds in my stack these days.

A millisecond is a fucking eternity. You shouldn't be doing a bunch of back and
forth bullshit in that kind of latency domain. Stream client events to server as
fast as possible, microbatch and process, prepare final DOM changeset and send
to client all at once. How could any other client-server architecture be faster
than this, especially if we are forced to care about a bucket of shared state?
