When you 3&#x2F;4, look at it, you&#x27;ll swear it&#x27;s spinning in one direction -- say, counter-clockwise. In fact, you&#x27;ll be so sure it&#x27;s spinning counter-clockwise, that the idea it could be spinning in the opposite direction will seem impossible to you. But if you stare at it long enough, and intently enough, you can make it spin the other way.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed the same phenomenon with political views.<p>People on the left think that anyone on the right is a lunatic, and everyone on the right thinks the same thing about the left. I, as most people do, lean in one direction politically, so naturally any comment I see coming from my side seems reasonable to me. In fact, it seems impossible that a reasonable person could think any other way. But since I grew up in a family that leaned in the opposite direction, and I shared their same mindset in my younger days, I can now draw on that experience, and I can take a political tweet that everyone on my side thinks is insane, and I can stare at it, and just as with the spinning dancer, I can flip it in my head so it seems reasonable.<p>To me, it&#x27;s a testament to the power of the tribal instincts within us. We think it&#x27;s the other side that&#x27;s crazy, but we&#x27;re all under the same spell. 1&#x2F;6",

I look back at Ben Franklin or Jefferson or Washington and feel inspired, I don’t think “oh, I’m not privileged I could never do what he did.” I can see people as products of their time and separate the good from the bad. As someone who grew up in an apartment shared between 2 families and worked my way up into college and the tech field I’m just shocked at how many people today have grown into learned helplessness and think that the system is so bad and irreparable that they need to vandalize and protest in cities for months.<p>The left has done so much more to insult me and my appreciation for this country than the right, and it’s just tragic that they think they’re the only good guys. I really do believe that foreign interference to agitate our society is real, as discussed by Tristan Harris in his interview by Joe Rogan, and it’s convinced millions of young Americans that they’re somehow resisting literal Nazis.",

This bias has been created in their minds by university professors who have never been to these parts of the country themselves.  The bias manifest in things like a coworker being afraid to accompany me on a business trip to Walmart headquarters in Northwest Arkansas thinking it was dangerously racist.  I had to explain to him that there are multiple cricket leagues in the area in that racism is not nearly as prevalent in the south as Hollywood would have him believe.  He ended up enjoying it so much there that he later relocated there from Fremont.  \nLiving near Boulder I routinely encounter the exact same ideological brainwashing amongst people who came to the US as students.  \nI say this is someone that is done extensive volunteer consulting work for the Democratic party including my last gig in 2014 for the midterm elections.  I agree with the vast majority of the Democratic party platform but have become very dismayed at them overemphasizing race as a motivating factor for their opposition.  I can promise you that for most southern Americans that vote Republican abortion is a much bigger factor in their vote than race.  and economics is much bigger than either those categories.",

He didn&#x27;t serve in the military but he very well could have, it&#x27;s totally within his character.<p>He&#x27;s not at all that far away from Mitt Romney for example.<p>Donald Trump is not a &#x27;Conservative&#x27; or even &#x27;right wing&#x27; really, he&#x27;s just a jerk who found a &#x27;following&#x27; in appealing to the worst qualities of &#x27;bad right wing tropes&#x27;.<p>&quot;In 1999, Trump described himself as &quot;very pro-choice&quot; and said &quot;I believe in choice.&quot; (Wikipedia)<p>Donald Trump was a tough-guy New York &#x27;kind of Democrat&#x27; most of his life. He always supported gay marriage. The Clintons were <i>literally at his wedding</i> to Melania.<p>He&#x27;s a serial scammer, effectively a polygamist who marries woman purely on the basis of their attractiveness and then dumps them later, cavorts with prostitutes, lies, cheats, steals.<p>He changes his political views to suit the day, because they don&#x27;t matter to him - he&#x27;s just about being rich and popular.<p>He&#x27;s managed to convince a lot of people that he is something that he is not, and that&#x27;s sad, and it&#x27;s brought out the worst in so many people, and that&#x27;s what we are seeing today.<p>Have a look at this Charlie Rose interview with Senator Jeff Flake who&#x27;s a much more traditional conservative, and FYI detests Donald Trump and &#x27;fell on his sword&#x27; rather than go along with the toxicity.

I don&#x27;t need to listen to anyone but Trump himself to realize he lies constantly and has only a rudimentary grasp of how government and society functions. His history in popular culture speaks for itself. So what is going on with the 70 million people who can&#x27;t see that plainly? The only conclusion we can reach is &quot;he says the quiet part out loud&quot; and that resonates with a lot of people. &quot;They are sending us murders and rapists&quot; was an early example that has stuck with me. Perhaps it is not a charitable view but nearly every office holding member of the GOP lined up to lick his boots after he said thousands of things like that.<p>As near as I can tell, Conservatism is deader than disco.",

Although most of those identify more with US politics than Canadian it seems. But for the vast majority it&#x27;s much less of an issue than it is in the US. For one thing, most people are not members of one of our federal political parties.  Local politicians don&#x27;t even align with federal parties, nor do provincial ones in all cases. Many people will shift their vote between ideologically similar parties, especially the Liberals and NDP.<p>Basically, for myself and most people I know, we vote for the party whose platform most closely matches our own priorities and beliefs, but it&#x27;s not part of our identities in the same way.  The parties themselves are also far less polarized than in the US.  And because it&#x27;s a multi-party system, you can have minority government that actually functions by garnering support of opposition parties.  (We also effectively don&#x27;t have multiple veto points though, so generally the governing party is able to govern; I think that also helps keep things from getting overheated.) Of course, the system isn&#x27;t perfect.  For instance by virtue of being both multi-party and first past the post, the winning party usually has the vote of a minority of the population, and still generally holds a majority of seats in parliament.  But I&#x27;ve really come to appreciate it in comparison over the past few years.",

Conversely it was recognized Trump would win if he had merely 270 electors of voters who dislike or hate one or more of the current items on the Democratic party platform.<p>Neither strategy can offer anything to the majority of the citizens in the political middle, the  true average citizen, since turnout has been driven by fear not opportunity.<p>Building a coalition from a carefully-crafted extreme attention-getting position, and pushing hard from there so the other side ends up below the 50 percent needed to be in power, has turned out to prevail over representing even the middle 50 percent of voters which is how it was supposed to be at a minimum.<p>So once the issues and&#x2F;or personalities representing them have reached full polarity, 50 becomes more of a constant to be converged upon from afar rather than a starting point to build a majority from in both directions.<p>Resulting in half the voters who turn out, and half the politically centrist citizens (which is a much larger group by a variable multiple of active voters) who will always be dissatisfied and these are two different groups (but having significant overlap), the latter of which is the core of the majority that all parties are supposed to be treating as constituents.<p>But the core of the majority in the middle doesn&#x27;t have a voice because they don&#x27;t have any party which represents them any more, the parties are doing other things with the money and the concerns of centrist citizens are given lowest priority.<p>The party gets more votes over the long run by fear-mongering against the other side regardless of who the candidates are at the time, and only declining resources can be justified which might actually benefit the majority of citizens.<p>Problem is, the majority are voting against their own best interest because their own best interest has not been available for a number of cycles.  Rather each side votes against what&#x27;s perveived as the other&#x27;s best interest instead, since that&#x27;s the only thing at stake anyway.<p>So the majority of voters end up speaking for the entire population as designed, but all votes are cast against someone&#x27;s best interest because the minority party is voting exactly the same as the majority in this regard.<p>So it&#x27;s unanimous by both parties that as few of the average citizens as possible should have their best interest be served, and to redefine democracy in that direction can not be accomplished during a single cycle or maybe not even a single generation.<p>Ending up with the choice between a trustworthy Joe and a dishonest Don the thing that doesn&#x27;t really matter to half the voters as much as it should.<p>It would probably help if there were parties which were younger than the candidates.",

The election results across all levels clearly illustrate just how divided and polarized this land is. Thus, it will take quite a lot of time and effort to see a reasonable progress on this front.

Masquerading as reporting journalism should be a big bad. You gotta disclose opinion journalism up front, like you gotta put a Surgeon General&#x27;s warning on cigarettes.<p>2. Mandate non-partisan districting boards and do away with &quot;safe&quot; districts.<p>This would lose majority-minority districts, which are responsible for a big proportion of our Reps of color. But safe districts skyrocket partisanship; politicians in safe districts can wander super far from the mainstream--think Steve King for example. And actually they oftentimes have to become radical in order to survive primaries. There&#x27;s only so much you can do here with the current system but, a little would help a lot.<p>3. Empower state and local governments by repealing balanced budget amendments and term limits.<p>State governments have really hamstrung themselves with these policies, and as a result the federal government has to do a lot. This creates a perception--right or wrong--that a far away government is telling you how to live your life. If the federal government has secured rights for all and managed federal concerns, it should be reasonable for say, Oregon to have one set of gun regulations and Illinois to have another.<p>4. Make voting compulsory, make Election Day a holiday, expand early voting, establish same day registration everywhere.<p>The majority of Senators (and in midterms, the majority of Reps) are elected by a minority of people who are much more partisan than the mean. This pushes politicians out of the mainstream.<p>5. Federally finance elections, shorten the length, and amend the Constitution to obviate <i>Citizens United</i>.<p>Campaigns and their ads are super polarizing. Special interests run messaging campaigns on wedge issues (abortion, immigration, gun rights) in order to pass bills like SOPA or subsidies for fossil fuel energy companies in the night. Campaign finance reform disarms all this.<p>6. Limit the terms of Supreme Court Justices to 18 years and enact jurisdiction stripping.<p>The stakes of Supreme Court nominations are so high that it drives us all crazy. We should limit their terms so that 2-term presidents get to nominate 2 Justices, and we should limit the power of the Supreme Court on the basis that it&#x27;s a deeply undemocratic and unaccountable institution. Pro-lifers feel this every day, as do progressives. We all agree it&#x27;s bad; let&#x27;s change it.<p>7. Enact affirmative action for mortgage companies, fund housing assistance, and reform public schools.<p>The US has a huge de facto segregation issue due to generations of discriminatory practices by mortgage companies, and the sky high cost of housing in neighborhoods with good schools. This creates fertile ground for bubbles and othering, not just in adults but also in children.<p>8. Re-establish affirmative action for colleges, and make it free.<p>The partisanship gap in the US now largely traces the education and income gap.<p>9. Establish clear boundaries on religious freedom.<p>Religious freedom is a fundamental part of the fabric of the United States, but so are personal liberty and individual rights. We need to give people the ability to live out their beliefs, but also establish a pluralistic society free of discrimination towards _and from_ the religious. Fighting a culture via religious freedom debases us all.",

I think it’s still hard for me, an over-educated progressive, to understand the American right.  Here are the problems:<p>1. Reality is often only reported in “liberal” news sources.  A lot of information is censored on right wing sources.<p>2. Both types of news sources editorialize in the headline.  Sometimes it’s hard to know they even refer to the same story.<p>3. People trying to achieve balance in reporting often relocate players onto the wrong team.  For example, the Mueller report is not a “left wing” document and balance is not achieved by putting Mueller against a Trump surrogate.<p>4. “Liberal” sources already include plenty of right wing opinions.  For example, David Brooks and Ross Douthat write for the New York Times.  There’s no equivalent among the Wall St Journal columnists or Fox News hosts.<p>5. News stories found only in right wing sources are usually mendacious.  For example, reporting about the Michigan ballot glitch without mentioning that it was human error and corrected before reporting the results.<p>Fundamentally, it’s not that we have differing information, it’s that we only accept information that confirms our world view.

Probably the worst thing about this election for me is that it seems to demonstrate conclusively that 2016 was no aberration, no temporary mass hysteria, no failed experiment in electing a political outsider to “drain the swamp”. This distorted world view of us-vs-them tribalism seems to have totally consumed our political system. Objective reality is dismissed by the majority of the population—most blatantly on the right, but also, increasingly, on the left. Even more shocking to me, highly regarded election data scientists have twice now somehow been blinded to this, releasing poll after poll that fail to capture what is actually happening in the minds of the electorate.<p>Carl Sagan, in his 1995 book ‘The Demon-Haunted World’, wrote:<p>&gt; I have a foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.<p>The moment he prophesied now appears to be upon us. I don’t know how we can restore this country to one where people mostly act in good faith and try to base decisions in science and fact. I see so many incredibly compassionate people supporting the most despicable politicians. Right-wingers on Twitter repeating false talking points that the left are trying to destroy the country while tweeting about how proud they are of local youth offering free lawn care to disabled and senior citizens. Left-wingers openly insulting rural and conservative people as the scum of the earth while relentlessly supporting policies intended to improve those same peoples’ lives. How does this happen?

I would oppose a traditionally conservative party politically, but would not be nearly as negative about it as I am about a President that seems to want to actively subvert rule of law.",

The world seemed less divided and closer together than ever.<p>Today, tensions between superpowers are up. Russia and North Korea have renewed the threat of nuclear armed conflict. The UK exited the EU. There’s an obesity crisis. Many of our amazing technologies have turned out to be terribly unhealthy and destabilising. Authoritarianism is on the rise, along with domestic and sectarian terrorism. The Western economy was shattered in 2008 and now there’s a global pandemic. Immigrants fleeing instability in other countries have led to political upheaval and conflict. The US became an unreliable ally.

Maybe they don&#x27;t like peace after all?<p>&gt; Nearly all western thought since the last war, certainly all ‘progressive’ thought, has assumed tacitly that human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security and avoidance of pain. In such a view of life there is no room, for instance, for patriotism and the military virtues. The Socialist who finds his children playing with soldiers is usually upset, but he is never able to think of a substitute for the tin soldiers; tin pacifists somehow won’t do. Hitler, because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional strength, knows that human beings don’t only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not to mention drums, flags and loyalty-parades.<p>&gt; Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a more grudging way, have said to people ‘I offer you a good time,’ Hitler has said to them ‘I offer you struggle, danger and death,’ and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his feet. Perhaps later on they will get sick of it and change their minds, as at the end of the last war. After a few years of slaughter and starvation ‘Greatest happiness of the greatest number’ is a good slogan, but at this moment ‘Better an end with horror than a horror without end’ is a winner.<p>-Orwell",

The right — belatedly (far too little far too late, and quite awkwardly) — has already started outreach to Latino and black communities.

Literally: nothing to fear here, white peeps... but with Kamala as VP — a powerless position yet a powerful symbol (especially as the VP of a VP cum President).<p>So It’s the changing of the guard. Republicans can no longer simply ignore black and brown people (at best) or use them as bugaboos (and then Democrats won’t be able to simply count on their votes by not actively being racist). Once the powerful engage those groups they’ll find them not to be uniform, and (hopefully) that will lead to meaningful, nuanced, deep engagement... if that happens, there will no longer be such a thing as the “black vote”. (This is further along with Latinos, where some groups aren’t too overwhelmingly for one party or the other).<p>So...<p>Not really an existential crisis, at least not to my mind. It’s real progress.

These days, it is China ( among others ). Do you see a pattern?<p>Increasing protests. I can give you that. BLM protests are probably biggest event in US political scene since Tea Party . That said, I am not sure, they are bigger than civil rights movement or Vietnam war protests. They are more visible due to social media. Thankfully, they seem less widespread though.<p>Blatant racism. Honestly, I am not sure if racism is a function of &quot;By what measure is the US more divided than in the past?&quot;. Quite honestly, I would venture to suggest that today&#x27;s racism is waay lower than at any point in US history. That said, this is just a guess.<p>Nationalism. Again, I am not sure if racism is a function of &quot;By what measure is the US more divided than in the past?&quot;. Historically, US gets more nationalistic as things go downhill ( WW2, red scare to name a few ).<p>So.. I am not sure you have a point here.

However, I&#x27;m being entirely serious and can&#x27;t quickly come up with a better way to phrase this:<p>How do people with functioning moral compasses come together with the kind of people who see pictures of children in cages and say &quot;America, fuck yeah?&quot;<p>How do people who want some form of democratic government come together with the kind of people who think it&#x27;s entirely right and proper for a president to do his best to prevent his political opponents from voting -- by disrupting the postal service, by soliciting the help of multiple hostile foreign governments to smear his opponent, calling for his opponents to be imprisoned without charge, and by attempting to halt vote counting in the courts?<p>How do people with any kind of respect for the value of human life watch video of the George Floyd killing and come together with the kind of people who watch the video and argue that the police did nothing wrong?<p>I don&#x27;t think these divides can be healed. These issues are not matters, like arguments over the size of government, where compromise is both possible and mutually beneficial. Instead, they are moral red lines about which compromise is neither possible or desirable. What the 70-odd million who voted from Trump want out of their country isn&#x27;t compatible with the basic moral outlook of the 75-odd million people who voted against him.<p>To take an extreme example, if a bunch of Nazis want to kill 10 million people, &#x27;compromising&#x27; by agreeing to let them kill only 5 million people isn&#x27;t acceptable -- and yet, this is exactly the kind of <i>moral</i> compromise (truly in the other sense of the word) that would be involved in bringing together Trumpist and anti-Trumpist factions.<p>In addition to the moral divide, there is a reality&#x2F;gullibility divide between the Trumpist and anti-Trumpist factions. Trumpists believe an awful lot of stuff that is factually untrue. They reject global warming and dismiss the scientific evidence as the product of a Chinese hoax to destroy America. 56% of Republicans now believe in Qanon (an ideological conspiracy theory born out of the argument that Democrats eat babies) to some extent[0].

So if you are skewing you poll to get a certain outcome and you know the poll will be averaged, you need to warp your results even further.<p>Ok, disclaimer time - I don&#x27;t have any inside knowledge or real evidence of any of the above.  It does seem to fit however.  I can&#x27;t explain why it seems all the distorting is to make the Dems lead seem bigger than it is - that is, why aren&#x27;t there pollers on the other side of the aisle doing the same thing?<p>So you&#x27;ll have to decide for yourself if there is any merit to the above theory.",

In this election, people decided who they were going to vote for historically early - the lowest portion of people in the history of exit polls indicated they decided in the week before the election. In theory, this effect should reduce the width of the probability distribution, and yet, the polls were off again, in the same direction as they are always off, by a little bit more than average.<p>A little scrutiny here is worthwhile. In 2016, for example, the polls were off in part because pollsters weighted the black demographic in proportion to their voting behavior in 2008 and 2012 (when a black candidate was running, boosting turnout). The actual 2016 black turnout looked more similar to 2004 or 2000 - other elections where a black candidate wasn&#x27;t running. Though I haven&#x27;t dived into the 2020 polling data, it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if a similar effect were at play.<p>It&#x27;s also become noticeable harder to do polling. Once upon a time, everybody had a landline, so random dialing worked really well. Now, some people have more phones than others, and people are increasingly less willing to talk to pollsters, increasing the error rate.<p>These are all important things to talk about - when you dismiss it as &quot;oh yeah, polls are never perfect,&quot; you prematurely shut down the conversation.

It is a harder question for social media to arbitrate centrally. For example, &quot;There is Fraud&quot; could be true or false, and certainly <i>somewhere you&#x27;ll find fraud</i> making the statement both true in fact and false in spirit. Then, there is the dark matter of <i>everything the newspaper doesnt even cover</i> -- US newspapers only regularly cover US news, allies, key areas of the world, and major events. Imagine a dairy-farmer trade war between two asian nations -- unlikely to be covered, so what is the truth? For that matter, imagine the civil rights of small minorities in the US -- depending on the minority group, unlikely to be covered even by major us newspapers.<p>Let me give you a harder example now. Anything to do spanning two sovereign nations, especially one involving war, civilian casualties, or war crimes. Pick your example: Russia&#x2F;Ukraine, China&#x2F;Taiwan, India&#x2F;Pakistan, Yemen&#x2F;Saudi Arabia. Both sides will have their national own newspapers which will support their own country.

On the contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself that it is the strongest, and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him. Nationalism is power hunger tempered by self-deception. Every nationalist is capable of the most flagrant dishonesty, but he is also – since he is conscious of serving something bigger than himself – unshakeably certain of being in the right.&quot;<p>The smart (if mistaken) reasons to vote Trump were always trade and the Democratic Party&#x27;s abandonment of Labor.<p>And Republicans, on the other hand, who think Biden is a socialist are delusional.<p>It&#x27;s possible, though, that people aren&#x27;t as dumb as they seem.

If they think they’ve lost their job to an immigrant who’s willing to work harder for less money, how does less government involvement make it better?  You can’t just ban immigrants and solve the problem because the real problem is a system that allows exploitative labor practices.  By American standards those immigrant workers are also getting a bad deal and the people doing the exploiting aren’t going to stop unless someone forces them to.<p>I think the reason you see people latching on to Trump is because they think all politicians want to maintain the status quo and they think Trump will break it.  I understand the sentiment, but Trump didn’t really DO anything to help them.  All he seems to do IMO is assign blame and talk about how things should be.  It’s easy to say “we have the greatest plan” or “everyone should live in a mansion”, but it’s really hard to actually have the greatest plan and to implement it or to build everyone a mansion.<p>It’s really sad because I think middle class America is being disenfranchised and there’s a near majority of people who’ve been convinced it’s the fault of poor, “lazy moochers” rather than the wealthy capturing and hoarding all of our productivity gains over the past 40 years.<p>I think there should be common ground in wanting to get rid of the part of the government that serves the interests of the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.

Moreover, as Michael Tesler has argued, economic anxiety and discontent among white voters in 2016 appear to be closely connected to racial resentment. His analysis of survey data indicate that many white voters, especially those without college degrees, believe that racial minorities and immigrants have been favored by government policies while their own communities have been neglected, especially during the Obama years (Tesler 2016b). The Trump campaign explicitly connected these issues by arguing that illegal immigrants were taking jobs away from American citizens and reducing wages for American workers.</i><p>&gt; <i>To sort out these competing explanations, we test the hypothesis that Trump’s surge among white working class voters, compared with previous GOP presidential candidates, was due to his explicit appeal to white racial resentment and ethno-nationalism. Thus, Trump’s campaign may have helped to politicize these attitudes, identifying them with a political party, especially among less educated white voters who tend to be less attentive to political campaigns and therefore less aware of differences between candidates on racial and other issues (Tesler 2016c). To test this hypothesis, we can compare the correlations between scores on the racial resentment scale and relative ratings of the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates on the feeling thermometer scale over time among white voters with and without college degrees.</i><p>* <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1177%2F0002716218811309\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1177%2F0002716218811309</a>",

Obama referred to himself as a Reagan Republican and Biden is even more right-leaning. Even figures like AOC and Bernie Sanders are extremely anodyne, not at all “left wing” just barely more liberal than American centrists.<p>The “centrist” view in America is extremely far to the right, which then allows factions like Trump’s to be far right to deeply fascist, racist extremes (this is not hyperbole, Trump is dangerously fascist) and yet still act like he’s just “on the right” because “centrist” positions in the US are themselves so deeply far right already.<p>The US really urgently needs more mainstream <i>far left</i> politicians, instead of nearly-Republican examples like Harris, Warren, Biden, Buttigieg, etc. AOC &amp; Sanders are the closest, but by no means do they represent views that are anywhere near being a healthy “far left” ideology to help draw a compromise from the far right and towards a healthier centrist position.<p>“Centrist” in the US would at least be on the fence of letting individual own assault rifles, withdrawing federal funds for abortion, reducing the EPA and decommitting from international agreements on climate change, granting large tax breaks to corporations, eliminating social welfare programs for oppressed classes of people (in ways that overtly hurt the poor, minorities and women), and creating a legal chasm blocking any road to universal medical care, all while buying into jingoistic ideas about America being the best and dehumanizing other groups like immigrants and foreigners.<p>That’s the <i>centrist</i> position in the US. When anything further left is even suggested, the socialism boogeyman is drummed up and huge populations of people will vote against it for no other reason than “socialism bad.”<p>Any sense of acting like there’s a benign Republican core of ideas around states’ rights or lower taxes to be discussed in good faith is just gobsmackingly wrong about the US. That is just simply a falsehood.<p>What passes for middle of the road, “good faith” centrist discussion is deeply far right already, and “both-sides-ism” where “liberals claiming all Trump voters are racist” is disingenuously used to act like it’s “the same as” the behavior of the American far right is both completely wrong and contributing to the problem.",

It hasn&#x27;t been a &quot;good&quot; insight.<p>Federal Election records indicate that the leadership of technology companies overwhelmingly supported a set of values that their employees appear to just as overwhelmingly reject. That dissonance is really quite remarkable.<p>I see one of the fundamental challenges facing the new administration is how to address this. I am not a fan of government regulation, more of a &quot;let the markets decide&quot; kind of guy. I recognize however there is a systemic risk where the technology &quot;owner&quot; can exploit it to harm society in a way that was previously impossible.<p>While the country has focused on disinformation and hate speech, consider a company that controls, in real time, the self-driving software in a car. Such a technology, if weaponized, to could kill hundreds of thousands of people. Or it could be weaponize to kill select people who were in the intersection of riding in a self-driven car and in disfavor by the company that really controls that car.<p>Early on in my career I chose not to work for military contractors who were the &quot;big&quot; employers in Los Angeles at the time I graduated from college. They were clearly engaged in finding clever, or at least more effective, ways to kill people and that wasn&#x27;t where I wanted to spend my time. But what about someone working on self driving? It saves lives by avoiding some of the things end up resulting in crashes. But it also provides an opportunity for great evil.<p>Do we trust the person in charge to not be evil? Companies change and while they might declare their intentions when they are growing, what happens when they are on top? Sometimes those quaint notions get cast aside when being a little bit evil makes what you&#x27;re trying to do that much easier or maybe that much more profitable.<p>What is the appropriate response, in a democracy, to a small number of people controlling a potential weapon that can destroy that democracy? Sadly this is no longer an idle question.<p>I don&#x27;t have any answers here, just more questions.",

I heard the tire screech and looked over to see a driver clearly panicked both because they realized they nearly hit someone and there phone was now nowhere to be found.<p>That is a great thing.<p>But what if someone inside of TESLA, the folks who write the software and send it over the air to your car, decided to add their own &quot;feature&quot; to the car such that they could override the safety system with a network packet, or a text message to the car. That person would be in a position to tell the car to ignore its safety systems and kill its occupant.<p>It is kind of a staple of dystopian fiction, but now that we&#x27;re getting closer to having that software out there in real time, the question becomes less fiction and more &quot;What would have to be true for that to happen?&quot;<p>The change here is cars that are always connected to the Internet and have command authority over all of the systems in the car. Before if you wanted to alter the software controlling a car you took it to a dealer, or a mod-shop, but now it just shows up in your car. What sort of insider threat programs does Tesla have? What sort of controls are their on releases? Do third parties have any opportunity to audit everything in the code? What happens if Elon orders an employee to put some code in? Do they do it? Do they report it?<p>And not to pick on Tesla here, the same goes for GM&#x2F;Cruise and Waymo right? ALL self driving systems that are currently in development have full control of the car, an always connected component, and a dynamic software update capability. Should it be required they also have a mechanical switch that forces manual control without any means of circumventing the switch in software? That would have to come as a government regulation right? And then what happens when someone steals the Waymo van by throwing the switch and driving away with it?<p>Hopefully that gives you a sense of where my head is here in these questions.",

That would be a non-starter for the agencies that regulate them. When I see things like &quot;autopilot updates&quot; delivered to a Tesla as an update, it feels to me that self driving is an example of a technology that is &#x27;running ahead&#x27; of the regulators at the moment.<p>Consider Facebook, which is a popular bad guy here[1]. There have been &quot;crank&quot; bulletin board systems since the 70&#x27;s at least, and before that with HAM radio operators riling each other up over various perceived slights and insults. In 2016 we got to see that with a precision advertisement targeting system, and way more insights into people than ever existed before, companies like Cambridge Analytica could precisely target individuals who were susceptible to a particular line of reasoning. CA essentially offered Radicalization As a Service. We are still dealing with that to this day. Was there any reason to worry about BBS software? Not when it was a self selecting group. But when the BBS became a billion BBSes all hosted on the same platform with clear insights into the demographics, fears, and hopes of all of those BBSes at once, that was something new. And it changed the risk profile and was weaponized against people.<p>It has always been desirable for groups to find somewhat like minded people in order to form a group for collective action. That is the &#x27;demand&#x27; side of the question, but before Facebook it wasn&#x27;t economic to do that at scale. With Facebook it did become economic to do that, and it gave anyone a new capability. Not all of those people have (or had) people&#x27;s best interest at heart and so we get the bad as well as the good.<p>Prior to self driving cars with over the air updates, continuous network connectivity, and full access to all systems on a car, has their been the capability (actualized or not) for someone anywhere in the world to target a specific car and take control away from the driver. The previous poster child, for vehicles anyway, were cars with computers that controlled things like engine starting&#x2F;stopping and brakes. One issue was that you had to be near the car to know which one you wanted to attack. Self driving cars finesse that by giving you an interior camera view. It is a different realm of problem.<p>[1] I don&#x27;t consider Facebook a bad actor per se, I believe that the forces that motivate them (page engagement, ad clicks, ad sales, etc) find ways to be serviced. And those ways are not constrained by ethics.",

For dissatisfaction with a party for more mild than what the left has for Trump, officeholders leave and become independents or even flip to the other party; if establishment members of the GOP in government hated Trump even with 1&#x2F;10th the fury the Left has for Trump, or even that the center-right Democratic establishment does, they&#x27;d have all left, and either become independents, joined the Democrats or, given how many of them there would be if it really was the whole establishment, formed their own party.<p>Instead, they immediately dropped most of their pre-nomination complaints and jumped on board, because while he might not be their favorite, he&#x27;s a devil they have no real problem living and working with.",

But I think it&#x27;s good to consider what would happen in other countries should a character like Trump be elected. In Canada, a polarizing character like Trump would be exceedingly unlikely to form a majority government. As a minority government, they would be subject to &quot;no-confidence&quot; votes regularly. When a government passes a budget for example, if the budget does not pass the house, the government automatically crumbles and an election is called. Additionally, as the prime minister is simply the head of the party, his vote carries no more weight than other members, and he can be fired by his own party at any time.<p>A lot of checks and balances are baked into a multi-party system. One inherent advantage is less polarization, as there are more parties to represent the various views of the people. However, there are of course a lot of improvements that could be made to the Canadian governance system (ditching first past the post for example), but I do believe this style of government is more resilient than the US system.<p>At the same time, our government has not, and will likely not, be put to the test by someone like Trump. It is commendable that the US system has withstood what many feared could be the start of the downfall of democracy in the US.",

What he was accused of however, is <i>trying</i> to play nasty with votes, and <i>trying</i> to undermine the legitimacy of his loss.  To put it another way: it&#x27;s not that he wouldn&#x27;t transfer power, but rather that he&#x27;s willing to play dirty to <i>try</i> not to transfer power.<p>The reason why it was never realistic to believe he wouldn&#x27;t step aside is simply that he does not have the support to pull that off; it&#x27;s essentially a kind of civil war but one he (and any other president) would likely lose almost instantly - as long as it&#x27;s <i>clear</i> he lost the election.<p>And that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so insidious to undermine the election, because that will eventually pave the way to <i>actually</i> ignore election outcomes.  Even today, I suspect in all the partisan posturing some voters may have come away with the honest impression that there really was a stolen election.  Since democracy hinges on <i>the losing side</i> accepting that loss, action that undermine that are quite problematic.<p>President Trump&#x27;s action so far, both before the election and after, are entirely in line with the accusations against him; in essence: he&#x27;s willing to undermine democracy to try and hold on to power.<p>Had the election been closer, it&#x27;s conceivable he might really have engineered some legal shenanigans to try and steal the election.  And if he had been backed in that (which isn&#x27;t entirely impossible, because some of the toss-up states have republican-appointed courts, republican legislatures, and republican governors, and of course the heavily tilted supreme court now), <i>then</i> things would have gotten dicey.  In that situation, just like in other strong-man democracies, the outcome of the election would have been rigged.  Would democrats have backed down?  Or would they have disputed the elections, even though formally they lost them?  That&#x27;s the kind of thing that breaks a democracy; because both backing down and confrontation are terrible outcomes.<p>To their credit - because that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to work in a democracy - those toss-up states did not seriously try to steal votes (although the vote-segregation thing is pretty close).  And of course we don&#x27;t <i>know</i> Trump would really have stolen the election, given the opportunity, since it never arose.  But we can see that he took all possible steps in that direction at least; and that&#x27;s something the US needs to deal with in the future for the sake of stability.

The popular vote map was detailed enough for me to drill down to county level and finer. In states like Ohio, N Dakota and Nebraska with sparce populations and high overall Republican vote one would occasionally (but not infrequently) come across small settlements of 500&#x2F;1000 or so only 20&#x2F;50 miles apart where the vote in one was say D-70%, R-28%, Lib-2% and the other almost exactly the opposite with Lib remaining the same at about 2%.<p>This seems to backup your tribal identity point very well. Given that these settlements likely have only trees or farmland between them the figures are actually quite startling. I took into account that some may have been Native American reservations (which I&#x27;ve not yet ruled out), so I resampled in other states with low populations such as Vermont and New Hampshire and found similar instances (of course, with these latter instances the overall state figures had the Democrats in the majority).<p>These demographics are fascinating to say the least and I&#x27;m going to revisit them again shortly.",

It is mind-blowing that anybody is okay with not knowing.</i> Let&#x27;s not let that happen again. That should be the easiest law&#x2F;amendment to pass, ever. (Of course it won&#x27;t be)<p>We obviously have legal machinery in place to remove a president if the need arises, but it is necessarily slow and ineffective.<p>His term also (further) exposed big flaws in the way we put people on the Supreme Court. We should go back to the old system of a 2&#x2F;3 majority required. No more 50&#x2F;50 simple majority, as the Democrats instituted a while back. I find that a disaster.<p>The old 2&#x2F;3 majority generally ensured that people who were competent centrists got onto the court. Both parties were equally happy with the candidates... or at least equally unhappy!",

You increasingly need two six figure plus salaries to make it work. IMO, part of the problem is that everyone views housing as an investment. People trade real estate like trading cards. We forget that homes have a more fundamental purpose (to house people).<p>If you can&#x27;t afford a home, as a way to get your foot in the door, you can buy ETFs on the stock market. You can also buy REITs as a way to invest in real estate. There are even diversified REIT ETFs. It&#x27;s like being a landlord, you get paid dividends, but you don&#x27;t have to lift a finger. If someone has some money on the side but can&#x27;t yet afford property, this is a relatively safe way to get into investing and the real estate market IMO.<p>The unfortunate difference though is that mortgage rates are subsidized by the government, interest rates are kept artificially low. If you get a mortgage to buy a property, it&#x27;s effectively leveraged investing. You pay a small downpayment (as low as 10% nowadays) and you&#x27;re basically investing with someone else&#x27;s money. You can&#x27;t do that with REITs. Nobody will lend you 10X your downpayment at 2% interest to buy ETFs. If you can&#x27;t afford to own property, you are denied this leveraged investing opportunity.<p>Personally, as a condo owner, I would be OK with condo prices not going up.

This is why high density cities end up being unaffordable.<p>If high density cities are built up to accommodate more affordable homes and below market value homes, the residents effectively pay negative taxes by benefitting more from the city than they pay in as taxes. The math doesn’t work out. If it did, we would have more townships with high density as well as affordability..and cost of living going down. But in my observation,such things never happen. At least from the data I had collated from Bay Area cities. I would love to be proved wrong.<p>The only way..as I see it..high density home ownership can be feasible is if we have clustered communities between 150-300 households and each of the homes comes with assured employment.

Each ballot sent out is the specific ballot of a specific person. It’s certainly possible that some ballots were stolen from their intended recipients and mailed back with forged signatures, but what’s important is whether this could have been done on a mass scale to influence the election result. And the answer to that is no. A coordinated effort to fraudulently return enough ballots to matter would require large-scale raiding of  mailboxes to steal ballots, or stealing ballots in mass quantity soon after they were put into the postal system by each state’s election commission. The former is impossible, as it would require an organization comparable in size to the postal service to be able to go house by house stealing ballots as they were delivered, and it would be obvious that it was occurring. The latter is easy to detect and trivial to rectify.<p>In both cases, the fraud would be detected as soon as anyone who hadn’t received their ballot went to their state’s election website and requested another ballot and were informed that their ballot had been delivered and returned.",

Reason #2, the US system of federated States introduces great friction into any system requiring a central authority.<p>The absence of a national voter ID program perfectly exemplifies this. The US has an election system that works sufficiently well, so there’s no major impetus to overhaul how voters vote. And the US Federal government doesn’t even <i>have</i> a list of all US citizens. In fact, no such list even exists. Moreover, a lack of any existing documentation that a person is a citizen does not necessarily mean that they are not a citizen due to birthright citizenship or citizenship automatically inherited from parents.<p>Concerns about voter suppression induced by the introduction of a national voter ID are completely legitimate. The US Federal government lacks the capacity to ensure that every eligible voter is delivered an ID (lacking a list of all citizens), so the burden to acquire one falls on the individual. If this costs money, then it constitutes an unconstitutional poll tax. And in any case, since the Federal government is incapable of handling such a responsibility it would fall to the individual states, some of which have demonstrated historically that they will act to make the process arbitrarily difficult for individuals that the sitting state legislature would prefer do not vote.",

I can&#x27;t think like that anymore because a very significant part of the country chooses to be portrayed by an _objectively and openly racist, sexist bigot_.<p>Heck, I think I&#x27;m right leaning on most stuff in life, but I could never ever carry a straight face knowing I contributed to this disaster.<p>I would rather vote blank (I&#x27;m a strong believer in doing just that), against the system, than vote &quot;for&quot; a pig so as to not &quot;vote&quot; for the opposition (a typical argument used by trump &quot;non-supporters who vote for him&quot;).

Would I mind? And so we got to talking. But not about science. He wanted to discuss UFOs, &quot;channeling&quot; (a way to hear what&#x27;s on the minds of dead people -- not much it turns out), crystals, astrology ... He introduced each subject with real enthusiasm, and each time I had to disappoint him: &quot;The evidence is crummy,&quot; I kept saying. &quot;There&#x27;s a much simpler explanation.&quot; As we drove on through the rain, I could see him getting glummer. I was attacking not just pseudoscience but also a facet of his inner life.</i><p>&gt;&gt; <i>And yet there is so much in real science that&#x27;s equally exciting, more mysterious, a greater intellectual challenge--as well as being a lot closer to the truth. Did he know about the molecular building blocks of life sitting out there in the cold tenuous gas between the stars? Had he heard of the footprints of our ancestors found in 4-mil-lion-year-old volcanic ash? What about the raising of the Himalayas when India went crashing into Asia? Or how viruses subvert cells, or the radio search for extraterrestrial intelligence or the ancient civilization of Ebla? Mr. &quot;Buckley&quot; -- well-spoken, intelligent, curious -- had heard virtually nothing of modem science. He wanted to know about science. It&#x27;s just that all the science got filtered out before it reached him. What the society permitted to trickle through was mainly pretense and confusion. And it had never taught him how to distinguish real science from the cheap imitation.</i>",

The struggle we have is that popular majorities cannot enact their policy preferences, and then do not receive electoral feedback based on the policies they enact.

But wait, I can feel the recoil already, just a moment. For those of us in the conspiracy realm, who know about the real use of children for blackmail operations mostly by intelligence agencies but also by organized crime, pizzagate suddenly becomes much more plausible (note I didn&#x27;t say real). It&#x27;s not a popular position because most people simply <i>don&#x27;t want to know how dark the world really is</i>. The framing of Epstein as some one off independent abuser is actually part of the coverup of just one middle manager in one of said blackmail rings. He ran girls, others run boys. Top level politicians and businessmen are targets for leverage. If you balk at even this assertion just because of the &quot;crazy by association&quot; to pizzagate, take the time to lookup: The Dutroux Affair, aka Belgiums X-Files, The Franklin Scandal, the Finders Scandal, Roy Cohn (Trumps mentor)... as just a start. Also note: wikipedia will not provide good information on these kinds of topics. If one were to look at the entry for the Franklin Scandal without digging further, one would probably walk away thinking it was a hoax, which isn&#x27;t the truth at all.<p>On the topic of psyops, one of the most used techniques is called the &quot;limited hangout&quot;. I usually use the flat earth conspiracy as an example of this. Of course it is quite assinine, and should generally just be ignored as such, an analysis will show that those who talk about it (I would posit are often not organic), also talk about much more legitimate conspiracy theories. The intent is to make the more legitimate conspiracy theories <i>discredited as crazy by association</i>. Qanon is such an operation. It took what could have been a movement against the blackmail networks that have infiltrated and compromised huge amounts of business and politicians <i>on both sides of the isle</i>, and turned it into a partisan, quasi-religious outlet that goes nowhere, but always promises something is about to happen (keeping the partipants hopeful and distracted from more meaningful action) with the added side-bonus of being one of the best honeypots for metadata on those types in existence.<p>The Bill Gates topic is another good example. It&#x27;s easy to kneejerk dismiss those concerns as they sound quite outlandish... but again, there is at least a modicum of truth, or rather, a handful of reasons people should be much more skeptical of the intentions of Bill Gates on the topic. For example, Bill Gates had quite an extensive relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, something a cursory search on the topic from mainstream sources will give nothing more than a passing mention. He had a relatively sordid relationship with the pharma industry in India, one worth digging into. On the &quot;microchip&quot; thing, another great example. Gate&#x27;s related foundations and companies have openly talked about the quantum dot system, which is just readable markers to identify who has had a particular vaccine, and have actively partnered with the pentagon and darpa, and the ID2020 program is being tested on newborns in Bangladesh and homelss people in Austin, TX already. Those kinds of assocation alone are enough to at least empathize and understand where those who then take that and buy into the microchips story are coming from. So while it&#x27;s untrue that the Gate&#x27;s linked programs intend to put microchips in, the talk of digital certificates linked to biometrics such as quantum dot scare people, and then combine that with the fact that DARPA and the pentagon <i>have been investigating such microchips</i>, along with a history of medically experimenting on humans without consent, it&#x27;s easy to see the jump to conclusions being made.<p>Given the huge amount of propaganda being heaped on the American public from all sides then, I think you should reconsider judging so harshly those who have fallen victim to that propaganda, and instead should focus on the purveyors and originators of that propaganda. To be frank, I also find this disproportionate judging of people in the current day to be very unprincipled also. We can invade countries illegally, murder hundreds of thousands of people abroad... and crickets... but talk about how the same engine that did that abroad is now turning it&#x27;s eye of sauron back towards us, inward, and you must be a batshit crazy conspiracy theorist. To just now be losing faith in America&#x2F;it&#x27;s people is myopic at best. Try to judge a bit less, and exercise a bit more empathy and even sympathy for those who have fallen for the untrue (which is literally all of us, to some degree), and understand the outlandish might not be as unplausible as you might think, and you will be on a better path to engaging genuinely with such people.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=r-GppBpUeYg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=r-GppBpUeYg</a>",

Wouldn&#x27;t be a big take away now the reform of the Elector College and the shift to a direct vote from the people ?<p>As a nonUS citizen from a country in which the head of state is being elected directly from the people, I find it very unsettling that there have been cases in which the president in US elections was running behind in popular votes and by a big amount of votes, which almost happened here. I&#x27;ve tried to research it a bit but I couldn&#x27;t still understand why especially since the House and Senate members are elected by popular vote already<p>I&#x27;d appreciate any insights here",

          "content": "<p>The Constitution of the United States is a document written to preserve co-equal sovereignty of a bunch of states that wanted to be closer to nations than provinces, while avoiding the then-very-apparent risk of centralized absolute governing authority.<p>The framers of the Constitution didn&#x27;t get everything right, but it&#x27;s very useful to keep that perspective in mind when trying to understand the form of the US government.<p>If you take the perspective of states as sovereign, with federation between them, then the Electoral College starts to make a lot more sense. The goal was to preserve the power of a <i>state</i> in the federal government, as much as to represent the collection of people from all states - both concepts were critical. The idea is that people from the nation deserve representation <i>and</i> that each state (and the people from that state as a sub-population) deserve representation.<p>If federation of states is a core concept of the subdivision of governing responsibility, then it makes sense to build a system that ensures each state has meaningful weight in the governance of that federation.<p>None of this is an argument for or against the Electoral College, nor should it be interpreted as arguing for the correctness&#x2F;effectiveness&#x2F;righteousness&#x2F;morality of the institution. It is simply an attempt to share perspective to help understand why the system is the way it is.<p>As originally defined, the House of Representatives was the only piece of the federal government intended to directly represent the people of the nation. Senators were originally chosen by state legislatures. The Senate was intended to represent the states, not the people directly.<p>The Electoral College was an intermediary to represent both the states and the people - as a compromise, it has many failings that seem obvious today. There is no federal mandate as to how a state&#x27;s electors choose to cast their votes. Each state is responsible for regulating its own voting - this includes how people vote and how electors are chosen and how those electors vote. It is mere happenstance that the majority of states have a winner-takes-all allotment strategy for their electors. Maine and Nebraska notably assign their electors proportionally.<p>It is also interesting to note that the tie-breaking mechanism for an Electoral College tie devolves to the House, not with one vote per representative, but with one vote per state. This is another example of the concept that <i>states</i> are a concept deserving of representation.",

Wars are expensive and ideally you don’t want to fight any. The existence of an organization like NATO means that (a) none of the member nations are going to fight each other, (b) none of the member nations are going to try to rival the military hegemon, (c) nobody outside of the organization is going to start a war with any of the members. For a military hegemon whose main interest is ensuring global peace so that it can continue to reap the rewards of a global economic system that it is also hegemon over, getting to mark off a large chunk of the developed world as “no wars here” is well worth paying for. In a very, very loose sense it’s sorta like an olden-days imperial power with tributaries, but the “tribute” is realized in the form of the fact that the US government’s position as military and economic hegemon means that it can manufacture dollars for free and other countries will trade goods and services for them.<p>On top of that, concentrating the defense spending of the alliance within the US is good for the US economy and critically important for maintaining the R&amp;D efforts that the US military relies on to maintain a technological edge over potential rivals outside of the alliance.",

All it takes is the spreading of false rumors through various means of the internet and social media for people to lose their minds and question their own democracy. I think both social media, advertising agencies, and the modern media is largely responsible for this. Also, us in the tech industry, who have over these last 4 years began to see the truly ugly side of what we&#x27;re building. In our constant need to hit KPIs, drive up SEO rank, drive virility, we&#x27;ve slowly fed a monster that is now making itself known, and disrupting the very fabric of democracy.",

      "content": "<p>As a Canadian, what stands out for me about the last two elections is that many Americans seem to desperately want a variety of political reforms, but neither party seems interested in providing them.  Trump and Sanders both sold themselves as reform candidates in 2016, but only Trump wound up on the ticket.<p>Sanders might be the real deal, but he&#x27;s not going to represent a major party until donation and campaign spending limits (like we have in Canada) reduce corporate influence on U.S. politics.  Sanders scares away the &quot;big money&quot; that U.S. elections depend so heavily on.<p>Trump has not proven to be a reform candidate in any sense of the word.  As a political outsider with control over both the house and senate for his first two years in office, he had the power to deliver meaningful reforms, but didn&#x27;t.  Americans desiring reform <i>should</i> have felt deeply betrayed by Trump&#x27;s first term.<p>The democrats had a smoother primary in 2020, but decided on an utterly bland candidate.  Biden is a return to the status-quo.  I predicted that, after the last four years, a return to the status quo would appeal to many, but this election proves otherwise.  This <i>should</i> have been an <i>easy</i> slam dunk for the Democrats to win, but it&#x27;s turned out to be a squeaker!<p>If the democrats ride the status quo for the next four years and both parties were to run the same candidates again, I suspect Biden would lose.  The Democrats need to pay attention to what Americans want.<p>I would suggest that Biden&#x27;s administration should, despite running on a thoroughly status-quo platform, <i>embrace</i> reform.  Too many Americans mistrust their own political system, to the point that they&#x27;re willing to picket polling stations because they think fraud is being committed. That must be fixed.  Finding ways to reduce the influence of money on politics (e.g. campaign spending limits) would be a good start.  It will also be an easy sell to devolve and distribute some of the powers that have accumulated in the white house over the last several decades.  If you&#x27;re not comfortable with some of the powers Trump wielded during his time in office, then perhaps those powers shouldn&#x27;t rest with the POTUS.<p>Bottom line, if the democrats try to pretend Trump <i>never</i> happened and <i>couldn&#x27;t</i> happen again, they&#x27;re in for unpleasant surprises.",

For more detail, they want the two biggies, peace and prosperity.  For more, they want  &quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot;, financial and emotional security, love, home and family, good health, happy, successful children.  There&#x27;s not a lot to fight about there.<p>So, again, the fighting is from the less than 1% who want to use their money and power to get more money.<p>Of course, way more than 1% of the voting population are highly concerned about politics, are fighting, but, sorry, guys, they are foot soldiers, pawns, for the less than 1%.<p>As an example, let&#x27;s take one of the issues, say, health care. Glancing at history, US health care has come a long way since the lone country doctor with a one horse carriage.  In terms of current US medicine, he was not very good.  Point:  Health care has changed a lot and is still changing, rapidly.  So, what solution we come up with should accommodate such change.<p>Health care can be really expensive, and we need a solution for that.  We need in some sense to <i>level out</i> the costs, make them predictable.  Ways have been private medical insurance, health care membership organizations, and government provided health care.<p>So, here are the main concerns:  Private health insurance is too expensive for a major fraction of the population, so those people look to other options.  Then for the other options, concerns are quality of care (it might be too cheap and not very good -- loved ones could die), waiting times, and big tax increases.  Point:  These are all issues, but some examples can show that we should be able to do quite well on all the issues of quality, waiting times, costs, etc., well enough that we should not have much to fight about.<p>And there has been the issue of private insurance and \n&quot;pre-existing&quot; conditions.  We can all agree that it would be nice for private insurance companies to ignore such data, conditions.  And the richer US states did have laws forcing the insurance companies to so ignore.  But maybe now the US is wealthy enough to so ignore for everyone.  Hopefully.  So, we can all agree or nearly so.  Not much to fight about.<p>So, what is the cause of the the fighting?  With some approaches and situations, for less than 1% of the voting population, there is or can be a lot of money involved, or a lot of power and then a lot of money.<p>My view is that we can go down the list of main political topics and conclude the same -- for 99+% of the voters, there&#x27;s not much to fight about except some people, less than 1%, want to fight to make money, big money.<p>But for various policies, operations, programs, etc., it really is possible just to make a mess, to create waste.  At least the 99+% can be against the waste!<p>E.g., for the $trilions W and Obama spent on Gulf War II, was that from (a) people who were in line to make money from the effort or (b) just waste?  I&#x27;d say, some of (a) but mostly (b).  Point: Not all the issues are about the less than 1% seeking money and, instead, there can also be ordinary waste.<p>Bottom line:  The 99% should throttle the less than 1%, settle differences, and get on with life.",

Different colored people.  Weird people.  Other people; namely, not people like us, or not in our tribe, group, and...<p>Ordinary people do not have very effective representation.  Money talks.  And it should, but that brings me back to priorities again.<p>No judgement, no blame here.  Just observations.<p>I submit resolving these things to a more harmonious body politic is on us people.  I am not convinced anyone, or entity can just swoop in and improve things.<p>That is just where we are today.<p>One other observation:<p>Nations older than us have been where we are.  Their peoples have had to do the work to get past it, and have had to do that multiple times.<p>This tells me we aren&#x27;t experiencing anything fundementally new, in human terms.<p>But it is new to America.  New in the sense of the USA being young enough, and the pace of change in the world being rapid enough for the state of things to feel new, or like doom, or, or...<p>Given the burden of improving on our current state lies with us as people, citizens, I submit the following:<p>We all need to understand one another better.  That starts by talking.  Really talking and listening.  This is best done sans judgement, and with deliberate intent to understand better.<p>We all are where we are in life, and we all have made choices, and relitigating the past does not appear to hold answers for our future.<p>This is about what we do now.  It is about our priorities as humans and Americans too.<p>Take voting, for example.<p>People had the following options:<p>Vote Major Party<p>Vote other<p>No vote.<p>Everyone made their choice and had reasons, right?<p>If we apply the intent to seek understanding of one another and avoid judgement, that means having a talk about why people voted or no voted the way they did.<p>People no voting, often did so because they did not want to consent to, or endorse, approve of what they see as ineffective, corrupt governance.  Or they did not connect a vote to a positive future for themselves and theirs.<p>Why is that?  I think many, and include myself until recently, would rush to judge and blame.<p>A vote for non major party X really is a vote for major party Y.  Same for staying home.<p>After talking some, the idea of candidates interviewing for a job comes up and poor or toxic representation means not approving them for the job, and with that we see lazy, or stupid aren&#x27;t really valid as reasons why.<p>I will stop there, and urge you to think about how all of that is framed up as a duty, or burden and how people may reject all of that in light of what they may see as an irrational election.<p>Same goes for how people have voted or not before too.  Those decisions are made, cannot be unmade and people had their reasons for making them.<p>Notably, after some real discussion, the reality hits:  we can&#x27;t tell people to approve of potential leaders, and we can&#x27;t dictate what is best, nor their point of view.<p>We can talk to them and understand what they need to cast a vote.  We can attract them to join a cause and all that too.<p>So why doesn&#x27;t that happen more?<p>I submit this is a big part of the priority and mutual understanding and consideration discussion we all need to have.<p>Without that talk being a fundamental part of our body politic, we appear to be divided into factions, blocs who understand others, &quot;those other people&quot; increasingly poorly as pressure to avoid the worst continues to rise.<p>With that discussion, it becomes much easier to see what we may consider an obvious, rational choice, say lesser evil as an example, really is not so obvious, or may even be harmful, not a lesser evil, but perhaps just a different kind.<p>No matter how this all goes, at any given time our future is about the decisions we make together, the actions we take together, and the outcome we live with together.<p>The election is past us now, but please do consider it was about the votes people were about to cast, not the ones they may have cast in the past.<p>Talking about all that is much easier and can be far more effective when people are not also fending off negative, and frankly until we understand one another better, uninformed personal judgements too.<p>We are divided to a harmful degree despite all of us having the same basic humanity.<p>I urge you to talk, and I mean really talk with others very indifferent from you, who live differently than you do and understand one another better.<p>I do not know how we get our priorities in order as people otherwise.  And without that, we rub the risk of our future continuing to be an increasingly mixed bag for increasing numbers of us.<p>Finally, consider this idea:<p>When we make the discussion about what we oppose, it is not going to be about what we need, or want that is good.<p>Think about trying to lead a team by only telling them what not to do.  They will get somewhere, and it won&#x27;t be anything anyone opposed either.<p>We all benefit from an explicit, public good.  That means the basics are in order leaving people with free agency to get after better, or what they want.<p>Understanding one another better will make that explicit, public good more clear.<p>It will improve our basic solidarity as people, reduce division.<p>I submit one final idea:<p>There will not be a net public good we all benefit from and depend on, unless we make the discussion, body politic, about it.<p>And that is how I am playing it now, and have been for a while now.<p>I want and need to be voting FOR good, not AGAINST bad, or evil.<p>You probably do too, and I encourage you to make more of the discussion about that explicit, public good and demand our leaders do the same things; namely, understand the people they need votes from better, and to apply that understanding to propose policy people can vote FOR, not just default to people voting AGAINST the very worst.",

The issue is that the unified Republican elite, along with &gt; 35% of the electorate, is fundamentally lawless and anti-democratic, and will do anything it can to cheat its way into power. All three branches are implicated and have been for a while: Bush v Gore in 2000, the US Attorney firings, Shelby County in 2013, the refusal of the Senate to convict Trump in 2020, the disgusting anti-science politicization of coronavirus, and so on. The scale of Trump’s personal corruption is unique among Republican national figures, particularly in foreign policy. But the racist authoritarianism and fundamental disrespect for elections is a defining creed of the party.<p>One of the more unpleasant truth about democracy is that it’s quite fragile. In any real sense, the US has only been a democracy since 1965. When large segments of the population are ideologically opposed to democratic governance - universal human rights, respecting fair elections, following the plain text of the law, and so on - mechanisms by which democracy sustains itself begins to fail.<p>One possibility is to amend the constitution to change first-past-the-post voting in all local-to-federal elections, to let never-Trump types speak out without facing electoral suicide, and to divert right-conservative attention away from a single “leader” figure. And obviously the electoral college needs to go.<p>But the fact that more than 65 million people voted for Trump at all speaks to a great sickness and nihilism in American culture. Trump himself might be put out to pasture. But Trumpism existed before he got here, and it isn’t going anywhere.",

We don’t need to treat them like lost sheep who were incapable of understanding what Trump represents. There were a shocking number of horrendously terrible people in Germany and Rwanda, and most didn’t go to jail when the genocide ended. After WW2 it was really hard to find a German who would say they voted for the Nazis, and I am sure many or those millions of people led upstanding lives. That doesn’t make their decision to vote for the racist strongman retrospectively defensible.<p>(There’s also the related problem of “he can’t be a bad person, he’s nice to me!”)",

Nationalistic Americans flocked to his appeals to close off borders, to renegotiate trade deals, back out of agreements that hurt the US, and promise bringing manufacturing back into our borders.<p>Biden is a career politician so he knows how to say all the right words to appeal to as many people as possible, but where those words fail is in their over-promise in that the sum of policies put forth simply don&#x27;t add up.  Not that trump hasn&#x27;t made promises he couldn&#x27;t keep, but he has taken and put into motion a lot of things that represent a very nationalistic ideology.<p>Personally I think that even with the dysfunctional pathologically lying brain that Trump had, he was on the side with the better economic playbook.

Condorcet Loser Criterion: if a candidate would lose a head-to-head competition against every other candidate, then that candidate must not win the overall election.<p>4.

Independence of Clones Alternatives Criterion: the election outcome remains the same even if an identical candidate who is equally-preferred decides to run.<p>6. No favorite betrayal: Can voters be sure that they do not need to rank any other candidate above their favorite in order to obtain a result they prefer?<p>At least consider how 2, 4, and 6 affect alternatives like Howie Hawkins, Bernie Sanders, or Gloria la Riva to name some examples.

H. Clinton echoed this, with a haughty campaign that called people she should be wooing &#x27;deplorables,&#x27; skipping campaigning in key battleground states, and blaming sexism for some of her campaign failures (&quot;it&#x27;s about me&quot;) instead of self-reflection (&quot;How could I have had broader appeal.&quot;)  Even today you&#x27;ll often find people reminding you that Trump appeals to people without college degrees.  Outside of a pure data context, saying that over and over again suggests that somehow people with degrees are better capable of selecting the leaders of everyone, which is an extremely elitist perspective.  So Trump comes along, attacks NAFTA and free trade, speaks plainly and so forth.<p>Was he making false promises about returning jobs overseas,  helping workers and other Sanders talking points? Absolutely.  But the self-reflection that needs to happen here (given the loss of two dozen House seats and numerous local upsets) is, what are we doing wrong, here.<p>To wit:<p><i>Exit polls, which can be unreliable, pegged his national support at 32%-35% of the Latino vote. More tellingly were results in certain counties. Starr County, Texas, the county with the highest percentage of Hispanic or Latino voters — above 95% — voted for Hillary Clinton by a 60-point margin in 2016, but gave Biden just a five point win in 2020.<p>Even more amazing was Trump’s performance among Black voters. The man whose 2016 message to “the blacks” was very nearly a parody of long-ago New York mayoral candidate Mario Procaccino’s pledge that “My heart is as black as yours” must have found a new way to connect. Trump doubled his support with Black women, moving from 4% in 2016 to 8%, while upping his support among Black men from 13% to 18%. Remember, this was after four years of near-constant denunciations of Trump as not just a racist, but the leader of a literal white supremacist movement:<p>[...]<p>Trump’s numbers with the LGBTQ community were a stunner also, jumping from 14% to 28%. In September, a dating app for queer men called Hornet ran a survey that showed 45% support for Trump among gay men. Ever since Trump jumped into politics, media observers have rushed to denounce any Trump-related data that conflicts with conventional wisdom, and the Hornet survey was no different. Out magazine quoted a communications professor from Cal Poly Pomona as saying, “To tout a Hornet poll as evidence of LGBTQ support for Trump is clickbaity, sloppy journalism.” Even the Hornet editor scoffed at his own poll, before it all turned out to be true in the election.<p>Trump even improved his standing among white women, 53% of whom were already pilloried in 2016 for voting for a man who bragged about how you “grab ‘em by the pussy, you can do anything.”</i><p>(Matt Taibbi, Which is the Real &quot;Working Class Party&quot; Now?, Nov 2020)",

I was talking with a Trump supporter (I held my nose and voted for Biden, as I did for Clinton in 2016). He was pretty heated, because a lady he flirts with at work let him know that she was a hardcore Democrat and that she didn&#x27;t think anyone should vote for Trump. It was toward the end of a long day, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was up for the conversation, but he&#x27;s a pretty decent guy, so I engaged, and we had a solid chat.<p>I made a point that seemed to resonate with him - Biden represents high-level corruption, the kind of slick corruption that maintains stability and is relatively predictable. Trump, though, represents a mob style of corruption - or the kind of corruption you see from dictators in developing nations. If it benefits him in the short-term, and he can do it, he will. Chess vs Checkers. Some people prefer the latter, and it seems some view it as a more honest type of corruption, but for most people, stability is important.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of Right-leaning people would also like to see some form of ranked voting, so I think it&#x27;s the political parties (both of them) rather than the people holding things back.<p>I think you bring up key issues in your closing paragraph, but the implementation of Globalization is what really hurt the middle class in the US. Whenever people lose a proper balance, they will suffer, and I think most everyone can agree that the US did a particularly poor job of ensuring balance - probably not by accident.<p>Anyway, I feel for people who are troubled by the result of the election. I was in their shoes in 2016, and I can relate to some of their concerns. If we start from a place of understanding&#x2F;trying to understand, we can build systems that work for everyone. If we allow the two-party system to perpetuate artificial divides, progress will be much slower, and we&#x27;ll take more false steps. The loudest are typically the worst of us. We can&#x27;t fall into the trap of using them as stand-ins for the other side. This was much more ranty than I intended, but I hope it makes sense.",

I live in a place where I am exposed to the Trump viewpoint only rarely, and I found myself aghast at some friends who said they were thinking about voting for Trump.

But that Trump is authoritarian there can be no reasonable doubt.  He has a long record of using his power to fire anyone who speaks against him, to harass anyone who speaks against him who he does not have the power to fire, and to protect and grant favors to anyone who supports him politically, even if they have been convicted of crimes.

          "content": "<p>The last thing I want to do is come across as defending Trump, because I didn&#x27;t vote for him either time and am happy to see him go. But your reply is a perfect example of the problem I&#x27;m talking about, and it is present on both sides of the equation (i.e. I&#x27;m going to point some things out, but please don&#x27;t read that as meaning that I think this is a problem that only some people on one side participate in - both are incredibly guilt of it, generally speaking).<p>So here goes:<p>&gt; One candidate supports separating children from their families<p>This is objectively false. Nobody &quot;supports&quot; that position at all as a matter of policy - rather you have oversimplified a complex problem to the point of absurdity. A police officer pulls over a drunk driver and finds kids in the car. The driver is arrested. Do the kids go too? No, of course not. Is it correct to say that &quot;the police support separating children from their families&quot;? Only in the most technical and intentionally misleading sense. Is it their policy to find ways to separate kids from parents? Of course not. Are there sometimes situations in which the only practical solution is to separate some kids from their parents? Yep!<p>&gt; keeping them in cages<p>Again, nobody &quot;supports&quot; keeping children in cages. (and do keep in mind that these so-called &quot;cages&quot; were used by earlier administrations too) But consider this situation: your country has a standing policy that when a refugee comes to your border, instead of turning them away, you let them in, you keep them in a temporary facility while you try to go through the legal process of evaluating their asylum claims or whatever because your country also has a standing policy that people just can&#x27;t wander into the country unaccounted for. Most of the time, these two policies can be in harmony, but one day 20k people show up on your doorstep. Policy A says you don&#x27;t turn them away, policy B says you don&#x27;t let them loose into the country. What do you do? And I&#x27;m not talking about what would be the long term ideal, if we have unlimited time and money. I mean what do you do about this problem &#x2F;today&#x2F;? You&#x27;re probably going to scramble and set up some temporary shelter while you get the policymakers to start figuring out a real solution, but you can&#x27;t just call into existence beds, food, and furnishings.<p>&gt; and has lost track of 500 of them.<p>The president obviously doesn&#x27;t track them to begin with, so Trump obviously didn&#x27;t lose track of them (any more than the 800,000 who are reported missing each year were personally lost by Trump - see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-missing-children&#x2F;missing-children-in-u-s-nearly-always-make-it-home-alive-idUSBRE83P14020120426\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-missing-children&#x2F;miss...</a>).<p>I&#x27;m not really interested in debating these specific policies, because the larger issue is that you can look at things one of two ways:\n1) There are 70 million people who voted for an idiot. By extension, they must be terrible to some degree or another too.\n2) The solution to any &quot;interesting&quot; problem - especially social problems - involves tradeoffs, conflicting objectives, pros and cons. If the solution really were trivial and simple, we wouldn&#x27;t argue about it. The debate is because it&#x27;s so complex, and with any really complex problem, you can have very reasonable and intelligent people draw different conclusions on how best to proceed.<p>If you choose to see the U.S through the lens of #1, you may as well give up now, because it&#x27;s hopeless - those people are barely people and are separated from you by an insurmountable gulf. OTOH lens #2 is hopeful - you see that ultimately everyone wants pretty much the same high level objectives, the debate is the path to get there and how to spend limited resources. With #1, nothing will get done. With #2, potentially everything is possible.",

      "content": "<p>Since the oil embargo of 73-74[0], which was caused by the &#x27;Arab-Israeli War&#x27;, securing the oil supply from the Middle East has been a top priority of the US government. The embargo highlighted how vulnerable the US was to the Middle East. Since then, &#x27;Peace in the Middle East&#x27; has been a plum goal of successive US administrations. President Carter was able to get a peace agreement between Israel and Egypt[1] which contributed to his ultimately winning a Nobel prize[2].<p>Succeeding administrations failed to gain additional peace and instead leaned on regime change in an attempt to oust unstable governments and seat US-friendly, stable regimes. This approach failed in principle: Regime change itself did not lead to stability. But instead, led to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and ultimately, it was the protracted presence of US troops in those nations that provided stability. That stability was paid for with the lives of US soldiers put in harms way of militants from both within those nations and from outside of them.<p>Under Obama, two threats emerged: ISIS and an emboldened Iran. ISIS went from a &#x27;JV Team&#x27;, to controlling an area the size of Pennsylvania, spanning Iraq and Syria[3]. Iran was granted an agreement to suspend weapons-grade nuclear research until 2031 [4]. Iran may or may not be complying with the agreement, but it was known that they were causing instability throughout the Middle East, funding ISIS, Hezbolah, and planning and funding ambush attacks on US troops throughout the region[5].<p>This was the situation in January 2017.<p>Reviewing what the current administration has done since taking office, the coordinated and deliberate steps, and the results, have been astonishing, given the intractable and largely unsuccessful efforts to stabilize the region over the last 50 years:<p>a. Established &#x27;energy independence&#x27; by modifying US regulations on production of oil, natural gas and coal. The US became a net exporter of energy, reducing the leverage that the Middle East states have over the US[6].<p>b. Moved the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and recognize the Golan Heights as Sovereign Israel territory. This worked to gain trust from Israel, improving their willingness to participate in peace agreements. [8]<p>c. Coordinated with Russia to eliminate ISIS. It was completely eradicated, including US Special Forces killing the leader and founder, Al-Baghdadi[10].<p>d. Withdrew from the Iran Nuclear accord, and renewed sanctions against Iran. The funds provided by the accord likely were used in part to fund their terror activities.<p>e. Killed General Soleimani, who was know to be the mastermind and source of funding for terrorism throughout the Middle East, directed not just at US, but other Arab States as well. [7] d. and e. illustrated to the Arab States that the US was willing to take decisive action to quell the regional threat that Iran posed.<p>f. Withdrew troops from Syria, extricating the US from that war zone, after ISIS was defeated.<p>g. Begin withdrawing troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. Most Arab countries want the US out so they can self-govern again.<p>h. With the above puzzle pieces in place, the administration rapidly concluded peace agreements between Israel and three Arab states: United Arab Emirates, Bahrain [9] and later, Sudan. Other countries are said to be joining soon.<p>i. Earned 2 Nobel peace prize nominations for the peace agreements (for 2021, winners will be announced next September).<p>Reviewing this timeline, and the magnitude of this achievement, it&#x27;s hard to square the approach and its success against the claims of ineptitude leveled.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;history.state.gov&#x2F;milestones&#x2F;1969-1976&#x2F;oil-embargo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;history.state.gov&#x2F;milestones&#x2F;1969-1976&#x2F;oil-embargo</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;jimmy-carter-camp-david-accords-egypt-israel\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;jimmy-carter-camp-david-accords...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nobelprize.org&#x2F;prizes&#x2F;peace&#x2F;2002&#x2F;carter&#x2F;facts&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nobelprize.org&#x2F;prizes&#x2F;peace&#x2F;2002&#x2F;carter&#x2F;facts&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;International&#x2F;isis-years-jv-team-international-killers&#x2F;story?id=40214844\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;International&#x2F;isis-years-jv-team-inte...</a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.europarl.europa.eu&#x2F;cmsdata&#x2F;122460&#x2F;full-text-of-the-iran-nuclear-deal.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.europarl.europa.eu&#x2F;cmsdata&#x2F;122460&#x2F;full-text-of-t...</a><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.state.gov&#x2F;reports&#x2F;country-reports-on-terrorism-2019&#x2F;iran&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.state.gov&#x2F;reports&#x2F;country-reports-on-terrorism-2...</a><p>[6] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiny.cc&#x2F;oilexport\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiny.cc&#x2F;oilexport</a><p>[7] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiny.cc&#x2F;defang\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiny.cc&#x2F;defang</a><p>[8] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiny.cc&#x2F;Embassy\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiny.cc&#x2F;Embassy</a><p>[9] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiny.cc&#x2F;mideastpeace\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiny.cc&#x2F;mideastpeace</a><p>[10] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.njhomelandsecurity.gov&#x2F;analysis&#x2F;tag&#x2F;Abu+Bakr+al-Baghdadi\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.njhomelandsecurity.gov&#x2F;analysis&#x2F;tag&#x2F;Abu+Bakr+al-...</a>",
