<pre>
<kbd>Enter</kbd>: Read comments
<kbd>Space</kbd>: Read article in Reader Mode

<kbd>r</kbd>: Refresh

</p>

### Navigation
The following pair of shortcuts are recommended for browsing and navigating the 
comment section.

- <kbd>d</kbd>/<kbd>u</kbd> to scroll half a screen
- <kbd>j</kbd>/<kbd>k</kbd> to scroll one line at a time 
- <kbd>n</kbd>/<kbd>N</kbd> to jump to the **next top-level comment**


## üëì Reader Mode
Press <kbd>Space</kbd> to read the submission link in Reader Mode in the pager `less`. 

**Note**: some websites do not work well with Reader Mode. If the submission URL points to
a domain with known Reader Mode incompatibility, the link cannot be opened in Reader Mode. See [validator.go](/validator/validator.go) for a full list of incompatible sites.

If you suspect that Reader Mode might work on incompatible domain, and you want to bypass the validation step, 
press <kbd>t</kbd> to open the article. If the validation list is inaccurate, please let me know.

## üåà Syntax highlighting
### Quotes
Quotes are indented, italicized and dimmed in order to distinguish them from the rest of the comment.

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/quotes.png" width="800" alt="^"/>
</p>

### Hacker News and forum idiosyncrasies
Code snippets, `@username` mentions, `$variables` and URLs are highlighted.

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/commentSyntax.png" width="700" alt="^"/>
</p>

### References
References on Hacker News are formatted as numbers inside brackets. `circumflex` highlights these numbers
for easier cross-referencing.

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/linkHighlights.png" width="500" alt="^"/>
</p>

### Categories
Headlines containing the text `Ask HN`, `Tell HN`, `Show HN` and `Launch HN` are highlighted.

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/showtell.png" width="250" alt="^"/>
</p>

### YC-funded startups
[Twice a year](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/), Y Combinator funds start-ups through its accelerator program.
`circumflex` highlights these startups to signalize their affiliation with YC.

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/yc.png" width="350" alt="^"/>
</p>


## ‚ù§Ô∏è Favorites
Save submissions you'd like to revisit by adding them to Favorites. Press <kbd>f</kbd> to add the
currently highlighted submission to your list of favorites. Remove submissions from the Favorites 
page with <kbd>x</kbd>.

You can add any submission by its ID from the command line:
```console
clx add [id]
```

Favorites are stored in `~/.config/circumflex/favorites.json`. `circumflex` pretty-prints 
`favorites.json` to make it both human-readable and VCS-friendly.


## üìê Fine-tuning

### Different standards
`circumflex` aims to be as compatible in as many setups as possible by following standard
terminal conventions. However, not all conventions are agreed upon and not everything is 
standardized. 

Because terminal emulators implementations vary, some adjustment might 
be beneficial for getting most of out of `circumflex`. 

### Disconnected indentation blocks

In some terminals and configurations, the indentation block (the bar to the left of the comment)
might appear disconnected.

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/disconnected_indentations.png" width="700" alt="^"/>
</p>

Set `CLX_ALT_INDENT_BLOCK` to `true` to use a different indent block character which will
appear as one connected line.

### Low contrast headers
#### Overview
Terminals can brighten text in bold in order to give them better contrast in dark color 
schemes. `circumflex` uses bold text to give headers and authors names additional contrast 
for better legibility. 

See example screenshots below (low contrast header) and above (low 
contrast author name) of terminal output which does not brighted bold fonts.

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/low_contrast.png" width="500" alt="^"/>
</p>

Below are a few examples of how to enable bold text in bright colors in different terminals.

##### Alacritty

- Set `draw_bold_text_with_bright_colors` to `true`
- Define `bright_foreground` and set it to a brighter value than `foreground`
- (See [alacritty/alacritty/pull/1026](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/pull/1026) for 
more info)

##### Terminal (macOS)

- Check `Use bright colors for bold text` under Profiles

##### iTerm (macOS)

- Check `Brighten bold text` under Profiles ‚Üí Colors

#### Classic Hacker News header
You can enable the classic Hacker News header with the `-n` flag.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

### Overview
#### Configuration options

There are three ways to configure `circumflex`:

1. run `clx` with flags
2. create a config file in `~/.config/circumflex/config.env`
3. set environment variables in your shell

#### Flags
The easiest and quickest way to configure `circumflex` is by running `clx` with flags.
To see a list of available flags, run the following:

```console
clx help
```

#### Changing settings through `config.env`

The following command will create a config file in  `~/.config/circumflex/config.env`:

```console
clx config
```

The example config contains all the available options. All fields are commented out and set to their default values.
Uncomment and set the values of the settings you want to change.

#### Changing settings with environment variables
You can configure `circumflex` by setting 
[environment variables](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/117467/how-to-permanently-set-environmental-variables).
Below are a couple of examples on how to set the variables in different shells. 

Bash and Zsh:
```bash
export CLX_COMMENT_WIDTH=65
```

Fish:
```fish
set -x CLX_COMMENT_WIDTH "65"
```

### Available settings

The following table shows the different ways in which `circumflex` can be configured:

| Flag  | Description |
| :---- | :---------- |
| `-c`  | Set the number of characters on each line for comments, replies and descriptions in settings. Set to 0 to use the whole screen. |
| `-i`  | Set the number of whitespaces prepended to each reply multiplied by the indent level. |
| `-l`  | Disables syntax highlighting for the headlines. |
| `-o`  | Disables syntax highlighting in the comment section. |
| `-s`  | Convert smileys emojis. |
| `-d`  | Do not mark submissions as read after entering the comment section. |
| `-r`  | Show each line with a number relative to the currently selected element. Similar to Vim's hybrid line number mode. |
| `-p`  | Shorten replies so that the total length, including indentation, is the same as the comment width. Best used when Indent Size is small to avoid deep replies being too short. |
| `-a`  | Use an alternate indent block if the normal one does not appear as one connected line. |
| `-j`  | Show `X is hiring` posts from YC-funded startups. Does not affect the monthly `Who is Hiring?` posts. |
| `-t`  | Hide the indentation symbol from the comment section. Does not affect quotes. |
| `-n`  | Set the header to orange |
