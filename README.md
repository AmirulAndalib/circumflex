When building from source, make sure the dependencies [`less`](http://greenwoodsoftware.com/less/) and 
[`lynx`](https://lynx.invisible-island.net/lynx.html) are installed on your system.

## üí¨ Comment section

### Overview
Comments are pretty-printed and piped to the pager `less`. To present a nice and readable comment section,
`circumflex` features:

* Text in **bold**, _italics_, [hyperlinks](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda) and
  `code` where available
* Labels for Original Posters (`OP`), Parent Posters (`PP`) and moderators (`mod`)
* Adjustable margins and comment width

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/comments.png" width="600" alt="^"/>
</p>

### Jumping between top-level comments
`circumflex` prints every top-level comment with the string `::`. Using `less`'s search functionality,
one can move between top-level posts by searching for `::`.

To navigate between top-level comments, press <kbd>/</kbd> to search for `::`. Then, press <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>N</kbd> to jump forwards and backwards, respectively.

<pre>  
  <kbd>/</kbd>: search
  <kbd>n</kbd>: repeat search forwards
  <kbd>N</kbd>: repeat search backward
</pre>

`less` remembers your search term between sessions. This means that the next time you want to jump between top-level posts, you can hit <kbd>n</kbd> to go to the next `::` directly.

## üëì Reader Mode
Press <kbd>Space</kbd> to read the submission link in Reader Mode. 

Note: some website do not work well with Reader Mode. Sites and submission types that are known to have compatibility issues
will not open in Reader Mode. See [validator.go](/validator/validator.go) for a full list of incompatible sites.

If you suspect that Reader Mode might work on incompatible sites, press <kbd>t</kbd> to force Reader Mode for the submission
link.

## üåà Syntax highlighting
### Comment section
#### Quotes
Quotes are indented, italicized and dimmed in order to distinguish them from the rest of the comment.

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/quotes.png" width="800" alt="^"/>
</p>

#### Mentions and code snippets
Mentions are yellow and code snippets are blue.

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/mentions.png" width="700" alt="^"/>
</p>

#### References
References on Hacker News are formatted as numbers inside brackets. `circumflex` highlights these numbers
for easier cross-referencing.

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/linkHighlights.png" width="700" alt="^"/>
</p>

### Headlines
#### Categories
Headlines containing the text `Ask HN`, `Tell HN`, `Show HN` and `Launch HN` are highlighted. On by default,
but can be disabled.

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/showtell.png" width="250" alt="^"/>
</p>

#### YC-funded startups
[Twice a year](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/), Y Combinator funds start-ups through its accelerator program.
`circumflex` highlights these startups to signalize their affiliation with YC. On by default, but can be disabled.

</p>



## ‚ù§Ô∏è Favorites
Save submissions you'd like to revisit by adding them to Favorites. Press <kbd>f</kbd> to add the
currently highlighted submission to your list of favorites. Press <kbd>F</kbd> to add a submission by ID. 

Remove submissions with <kbd>x</kbd>.

Favorites are stored in `~/.config/circumflex/favorites.json`.

## üìê Fine-tuning

### Different standards
`circumflex` aims to be as compatible in as many setups as possible by following standard
terminal conventions. However, not all conventions are agreed upon and not everything is 
standardized. 

Because terminal emulators implementations vary, some adjustment might 
be beneficial for getting most of out of `circumflex`. 

### Disconnected indentation blocks

In some terminals and configurations, the indentation block (the bar to the left of the comment)
might appear disconnected.

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/disconnected_indentations.png" width="700" alt="^"/>
</p>

Set `CLX_ALT_INDENT_BLOCK` to `true` to use a different indent block character which will
appear as one connected line.

### Low contrast headers
#### Overview
Terminals can brighten text in bold in order to give them better contrast in dark color 
schemes. `circumflex` uses bold text to give headers and authors names additional contrast 
for better legibility. 

See example screenshots below (low contrast header) and above (low 
contrast author name) of terminal output which does not brighted bold fonts.

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/low_contrast.png" width="500" alt="^"/>
</p>

Below are a few examples of how to enable bold text in bright colors in different terminals.

#### alacritty

Set `draw_bold_text_with_bright_colors` to `true`. Then, define `bright_foreground` and 
set it to a brighter value than `foreground`. See 
[alacritty/alacritty/pull/1026](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/pull/1026) for 
more info.

#### Terminal (macOS)
Check `Use bright colors for bold text` under Profiles.

#### iTerm (macOS)
Check `Brighten bold text` under Profiles ‚Üí Colors.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

### Overview
#### Configuration options

To change the settings, you can either:

1. create a config file in `~/.config/circumflex/config.env`, or
2. set environment variables in your shell


#### Changing settings through `config.env`

The following command will create a config file in  `~/.config/circumflex/config.env`:

```console
clx create_example_config
```

The example config contains all the available options. All fields are commented out and set to their default values.
Uncomment and set the values of the settings you want to change.

#### Changing settings with environment variables
Depending on your preference, it might be more convenient for you to configure `circumflex` by setting
[environment variables](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/117467/how-to-permanently-set-environmental-variables).
Below are a couple of examples on how to set the variables in different shells. 

Run the commands directly from your
shell to set the value for the current session. Put them somewhere in your
[dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/) to make the settings permanent.

Bash and Zsh:
```bash
export CLX_COMMENT_WIDTH=65
```

Fish:
```fish
set -x CLX_COMMENT_WIDTH "65"
```

### Available options

The following table shows the different ways in which `circumflex` can be configured:

| Key                         | Default | Description |
| :-------------------------- | :-------: |---|
| `CLX_COMMENT_WIDTH`         | `65` | Sets the maximum number of characters on each line for comments, replies and descriptions in settings. Set to 0 to use the whole screen.       |
| `CLX_INDENT_SIZE`           | `4` | The number of whitespaces prepended to each reply multiplied by the indent level. |
| `CLX_HIGHLIGHT_HEADLINES`   | `2` | Highlights YC-funded startups and text containing `Show HN`, `Ask HN`, `Tell HN` and `Launch HN`. Can be set to 0 (No highlighting), 1 (inverse highlighting) or 2 (colored highlighting).        |
| `CLX_RELATIVE_NUMBERING`    | `false` | Shows each line with a number relative to the currently selected element. Similar to Vim's hybrid line number mode.        |
| `CLX_HIDE_YC_JOBS`          | `true` | Hides `X is hiring` posts from YC-funded startups. Does not affect the monthly `Who is Hiring?` posts.        |
| `CLX_PRESERVE_RIGHT_MARGIN` | `false` | Shortens replies so that the total length, including indentation, is the same as the comment width. Best used when Indent Size is small to avoid deep replies being too short.   |
| `CLX_ALT_INDENT_BLOCK`      | `false` | Turn this setting on if the indent block does not appear as one connected line. |

## üöó Under the hood
