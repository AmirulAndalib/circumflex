## üí¨ Comment section

### Overview
Comments are pretty-printed and piped to the pager `less`. To present a nice and readable comment section,
`circumflex` features:

* Text in **bold**, _italics_, [hyperlinks](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda) and
  `code` where available
* Labels for Original Posters (`OP`), Parent Posters (`PP`) and moderators (`mod`)

</p>

### Jumping between top-level comments
`circumflex` prints every top-level comment with the string `::`. Using `less`'s search functionality,
one can move between top-level posts by searching for `::`.

To navigate between top-level comments, press <kbd>/</kbd> to search for `::`. Then, press <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>N</kbd> to jump forwards and backwards, respectively.

<pre>  
  <kbd>/</kbd>: search
  <kbd>n</kbd>: repeat search forwards
  <kbd>N</kbd>: repeat search backward
</pre>

`less` remembers your search term between sessions. This means that the next time you want to jump between top-level posts, you can hit <kbd>n</kbd> to go to the next `::` directly.

## üëì Reader Mode
Press <kbd>Space</kbd> to read the submission link in Reader Mode. 

Note: some website do not work well with Reader Mode. Sites and submission types that are known to have compatibility issues
will not open in Reader Mode. See [validator.go](/validator/validator.go) for a full list of incompatible sites.

If you suspect that Reader Mode might work on incompatible sites, press <kbd>t</kbd> to force Reader Mode for the submission
link.

## üåà Syntax highlighting
### Quotes
Comment quotes are italicized and dimmed.

</p>

### Headlines
Headlines containing the text `Ask HN`, `Tell HN`, `Show HN` and `Launch HN` are highlighted. On by default,
but can be disabled.

</p>

### YC-funded startups
[Twice a year](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/), Y Combinator funds start-ups through its accelerator program.
`circumflex` highlights these startups to signalize their affiliation with YC. On by default, but can be disabled.

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/yc.png" width="350" alt="^"/>
</p>

### References
By convention, references on Hacker News are formatted as numbers inside brackets. `circumflex` highlights these numbers
for easier cross-referencing.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Favorites

currently highlighted submission to your list of favorites. Press <kbd>F</kbd> to add a submission by ID. 

Submissions can be removed with <kbd>x</kbd>.

Favorites are stored in `~/.config/circumflex/favorites.json`.

## üõ† Settings

### Overview
#### Configuration options

To change the settings, you can either:

1. create an example config in `~/.config/circumflex/config.env`, or
2. set environment variables in your shell

#### Changing settings through `config.env`

The following command will create a config file in  `~/.config/circumflex/config.env`:

```console
clx create_example_config
```

The example config contains all the available options. All fields are commented out and set to their default values.
Uncomment and set the values of the settings you want to change.

#### Changing settings with environment variables
Depending on your preference, it might be more convenient for you to configure `circumflex` by setting
[environment variables](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/117467/how-to-permanently-set-environmental-variables).
Below are a couple of examples on how to set the variables in different shells. 

Run the commands directly from your
shell to set the value for the current session. Put them somewhere in your
[dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/) to make the settings permanent.

Bash and Zsh:
```bash
export CLX_COMMENT_WIDTH=65
```

Fish:
```fish
set -x CLX_COMMENT_WIDTH "65"
```

### Available options

The following table shows the different ways in which `circumflex` can be configured:

| Key                         | Default Value | Description |
| :-------------------------- | :-------: |---|
| `CLX_COMMENT_WIDTH`         | `70` | Sets the maximum number of characters on each line for comments, replies and descriptions in settings. Set to 0 to use the whole screen.       |
| `CLX_INDENT_SIZE`           | `4` | The number of whitespaces prepended to each reply multiplied by the indent level. |
| `CLX_HIGHLIGHT_HEADLINES`   | `2` | Highlights YC-funded startups and text containing `Show HN`, `Ask HN`, `Tell HN` and `Launch HN`. Can be set to 0 (No highlighting), 1 (inverse highlighting) or 2 (colored highlighting).        |
| `CLX_RELATIVE_NUMBERING`    | `false` | Shows each line with a number relative to the currently selected element. Similar to Vim's hybrid line number mode.        |
| `CLX_HIDE_YC_JOBS`          | `true` | Hides `X is hiring` posts from YC-funded startups. Does not affect the monthly `Who is Hiring?` posts.        |
| `CLX_PRESERVE_RIGHT_MARGIN` | `false` | Shortens replies so that the total length, including indentation, is the same as the comment width. Best used when Indent Size is small to avoid deep replies being too short.   |
| `CLX_ALT_INDENT_BLOCK`      | `false` | Turn this setting on if the indent block does not appear as one connected line. |
