## Overview

### Features

`circumflex` is a text-based user interface (TUI) application that lets you browse Hacker News in your terminal. It can
list submissions by category and show the comment section. It is made to look good across different color schemes.

`circumflex` does not support any login related functionality.

### Comment section

Comments are pretty-printed and piped to the pager `less`. To present a nice and readable comment section,
`circumflex` features:

* Text in **bold**, _italics_, [hyperlinks](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda) and
  `code` where available
* Colored references (`[1]`, `[2]`, `[â€¦]`)
* Labels for Original Posters (`OP`), Parent Posters (`PP`) and moderators (`mod`)
* Ability to jump between top-level comments by searching for `::`

## Settings

### How to configure

There are two ways to configure `circumflex`:

1. Edit `config.env` in `~/.config/circumflex`, or
3. Set environment variables in your shell

#### Using `config.env`
To access the settings menu, press <kbd>i</kbd> on the main screen and then <kbd>Tab</kbd> to get to the settings
section. This view shows the available options along with the current values. Overridden values are marked with `*`.

`circumflex` can create a `config.env` in `~/.config/circumflex` by pressing <kbd>t</kbd> on the settings menu. This
file will contain the available options, their descriptions and default values.

#### Using environment variables
Depending on your workflow, it might be more convenient for you to configure `circumflex` by setting [environment variables](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/117467/how-to-permanently-set-environmental-variables).

Bash and zsh:
```bash
export CLX_COMMENT_WIDTH=65
```

Fish:
```fish
set -x CLX_COMMENT_WIDTH "65"
```

### Available options

The following table shows the ways `circumflex` can be configured.

| Key      | Default Value | Description |
| :-----------: | :-------: |---|
| `CLX_COMMENT_WIDTH`      | `70` | Sets the maximum number of characters on each line for comments, replies and descriptions in settings. Set to 0 to use the whole screen.       |
| `CLX_INDENT_SIZE`   | `4` | The number of whitespaces prepended to each reply, not including the color bar.        |
| `CLX_HIGHLIGHT_HEADLINES`   | `2` | Highlights YC-funded startups and text containing `Show HN`, `Ask HN`, `Tell HN` and `Launch HN`. Can be set to 0 (No highlighting), 1 (inverse highlighting) or 2 (colored highlighting).        |
| `CLX_RELATIVE_NUMBERING`   | `false` | Shows each line with a number relative to the currently selected element. Similar to Vim's hybrid line number mode.        |
| `CLX_HIDE_YC_JOBS`   | `true` | Hides `X is hiring` posts from YC-funded startups. Does not affect the monthly `Who is Hiring?` posts.        |
| `CLX_PRESERVE_RIGHT_MARGIN`   | `false` | Shortens replies so that the total length, including indentation, is the same as the comment width. Best used when Indent Size is small to avoid deep replies being too short.   |
